This popular staple of the casino floor can be beaten with a little bit of practice and some insider knowledge. Here are three secrets to help you start winning at video poker:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the right machine</li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re first starting out, it’s important to choose the right video poker machine. Not all machines are created equal, and some offer better odds than others. Look for machines that offer a payout percentage of 99% or higher.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Play according to your skill level</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t overreach when you’re starting out; play at a level that’s appropriate for your skill set. If you’re just starting out, stick to basic games until you’ve got the hang of things. As you improve, move on to more challenging games.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use strategy charts</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at video poker is to use strategy charts. These handy cheat sheets outline the best way to play each hand, depending on the particular game you’re playing. You can find plenty of free strategy charts online, or purchase a printed chart specifically designed for your game type.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Video-Poker-like-a-Pro-and-Win-Every-Time"><a href="#How-to-Play-Video-Poker-like-a-Pro-and-Win-Every-Time" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Video Poker like a Pro and Win Every Time"></a>How to Play Video Poker like a Pro and Win Every Time</h1><p>Heard of poker? How about video poker? What if I were to tell you that by playing video poker the right way, you could win every time? Would you believe me?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, learning a few simple rules can put the odds in your favor when playing video poker. In this article, we’re going to take a look at how to play video poker like a pro and come out a winner every time.</p>
<p>First and foremost, always choose the game with the best return to player (RTP) percentage. Not all games are created equal, so it’s important to make sure you’re playing the one with the best odds.</p>
<p>Also, always play the maximum amount of coins. This will give you the best chance of hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p>Never hold four cards to a royal flush - always discard one and hope for the best. The odds of getting a royal flush are slim enough as it is; don’t decrease your chances by holding onto four cards.</p>
<p>If you’re dealt two pairs, always keep the pair that has the highest value. For example, if you’re dealt two kings and two sixes, keep the kings. If two pairs are of equal value, keep the first pair that was dealt to you.</p>
<p>And lastly, always remember that practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better your odds of winning will be.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Crush-the-Casino-at-Video-Poker-Learn-the-winning-techniques"><a href="#How-to-Crush-the-Casino-at-Video-Poker-Learn-the-winning-techniques" class="headerlink" title="How to Crush the Casino at Video Poker: Learn the winning techniques"></a>How to Crush the Casino at Video Poker: Learn the winning techniques</h1><p>Casinos and video poker machines seem to be everywhere. So, it is natural that you may be tempted to try your luck. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>But if you want to increase your chances of winning and come out a winner, there are a few things you need to know. Here are four tips on how to crush the casino at video poker:</p>
<p>Tip 1: Play Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Deuces Wild is one of the most popular video poker variants. In this game, all deuces (two symbols) are wild, which means they can act as any other card to help form a winning hand.</p>
<p>This provides players with lots of opportunities to win big payouts, so it’s a great game to play if you want to increase your chances of winning. Plus, Deuces Wild games usually have a higher payout percentage than other video poker variants, so you stand to win more money if you play this game.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Keep track of the payouts</p>
<p>When playing any casino game, it’s important to know the odds and understand the payout schedule. This is especially true when playing video poker, as the payouts can vary significantly from one variant to another.</p>
<p>For example, in Jacks or Better video poker, the payout for a royal flush is 250 coins. But in Joker Poker – a variant with a different payout schedule – the payout for a royal flush is 800 coins. So make sure you know what the payouts are for each variant before you start playing.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Use optimal strategy</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at video poker is by using optimal strategy. This involves making the best possible decisions based on the cards you are dealt and the payout schedule. You can find detailed optimal strategy charts online that will show you exactly what moves to make in any situation.</p>
<p>Tip 4: Bet max when possible</p>
<p>In most video poker variants, players are allowed to bet up to five coins per hand. And while betting five coins won’t always give you the best odds, it can definitely increase your chances of winning big payouts. So if you have a chance to bet max, take it!</p>
