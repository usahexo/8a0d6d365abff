    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Mexico-to-Surrender-in-Drug-War"><a href="#Mexico-to-Surrender-in-Drug-War" class="headerlink" title="Mexico to Surrender in Drug War"></a>Mexico to Surrender in Drug War</h1><p>Mexico is expected to announce its surrender in the drug war this week, according to government officials.</p>
<p>“After years of bloodshed and loss of innocent lives, we have decided that it is time to move on from this senseless conflict,” said a spokesperson for the Mexican government.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the surrender agreement, Mexico will immediately cease all military operations against drug traffickers and will allow the United States to conduct all necessary operations within its territory. In return, the United States will provide extensive financial and military assistance to Mexico in order to help rebuild its shattered infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We realize that this is not a perfect solution, but we believe it is the best option available at this time,” said the spokesperson.</p>
<p>The announcement has been met with mixed reactions in both countries. Critics in Mexico argue that the country has ceded too much sovereignty to the United States, while some American lawmakers are concerned that this deal will only embolden Mexican drug cartels.</p>
<p>President Obama has praised the deal as a “major step forward” and vowed to work closely with the Mexican government to ensure its success.</p>
<h1 id="Mexico-to-Surrender-Territory-to-Drug-Cartels"><a href="#Mexico-to-Surrender-Territory-to-Drug-Cartels" class="headerlink" title="Mexico to Surrender Territory to Drug Cartels"></a>Mexico to Surrender Territory to Drug Cartels</h1><p>Mexico is set to give up a large swath of territory to the country’s drug cartels as part of a peace agreement, sources close to the negotiations say.</p>
<p>The cartel-controlled territory will be carved out of the State of Guerrero and will include the resort city of Acapulco. The deal is expected to be formally announced in the next few days.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the Mexican military will cease all operations in the area and withdraw from the region. In return, the cartels will agree to stop trafficking drugs through the area.</p>
<p>The move comes as part of a larger effort by Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to negotiate peace deals with the country’s drug cartels. So far, López Obrador has reached deals with six of Mexico’s seven major drug cartels.</p>
<p>Critics say that giving territory to the cartels is tantamount to surrendering to them and will only lead to more violence and bloodshed. Supporters argue that it is a better alternative than continuing with the current strategy, which has failed miserably.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure what effect this latest development will have on Mexico’s ongoing drug war, but one thing is for sure: it is likely to make things even worse.</p>
<h1 id="Mexican-President-announces-Plan-Surrender"><a href="#Mexican-President-announces-Plan-Surrender" class="headerlink" title="Mexican President announces Plan Surrender"></a>Mexican President announces Plan Surrender</h1><p>In a televised address to the nation, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced a new security plan dubbed “Plan Surrender”. The plan calls for all citizens living in areas known as hotspots for gang violence to voluntarily relocate to other parts of the country. The president said that while the government will provide transportation and financial assistance to those who relocate, it is ultimately up to the citizens themselves to decide whether or not they want to leave.</p>
<p>“The safety of our people is our top priority,” said Peña Nieto. “We can no longer allow our citizens to live in fear of being targeted by gangs or cartels.”</p>
<p>The announcement comes just days after 22 people were killed in a series of bombings in Mexico City. The bombings, which authorities believe were carried out by the Jalisco New Generation cartel, are just the latest in a long line of atrocities committed by drug cartels in Mexico.</p>
<p>Cartels have been known to kidnap, torture, and execute civilians who don’t cooperate with them. In some cases, entire villages have been forced to flee their homes due to cartel violence.</p>
<p>Critics of the president’s plan say that it will only encourage more migration from Mexico and that the government is not doing enough to combat cartel violence. Supporters argue that Plan Surrender is necessary to protect innocent civilians from becoming victims of gang warfare.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Mexico-is-Giving-Up-on-the-War-on-Drugs"><a href="#Why-Mexico-is-Giving-Up-on-the-War-on-Drugs" class="headerlink" title="Why Mexico is Giving Up on the War on Drugs"></a>Why Mexico is Giving Up on the War on Drugs</h1><p>For years, Mexico has been waging a bloody war against drug cartels. But now the country is admitting defeat and plans to decriminalize all drugs. Here’s why Mexico is changing its tune on the war on drugs…</p>
<p>In 2006, Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared a War on Drugs, vowing to crack down on the country’s powerful drug cartels. The effort was backed by the United States, which supplied money and training to help Mexico fight the cartels.</p>
<p>But the war has been a failure. In fact, it’s only made things worse. The number of deaths related to drug violence has skyrocketed in recent years, and more than 200,000 people have been killed since 2006.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the cartels have only become stronger and more violent. They now wield incredible power and control over large parts of the country.</p>
<p>And so, after more than a decade of bloodshed, Mexico is finally admitting defeat. This week, the president’s office announced plans to decriminalize all drugs, including cocaine and heroin.</p>
<p>The aim is to reduce the power of the cartels and make it easier for Mexicans to get help for addiction problems. It will also free up resources to focus on other priorities such as security and education.</p>
<p>This is a major shift in policy, and it will no doubt be met with resistance from some corners. But it’s a step in the right direction, and hopefully it will lead to a more peaceful future for Mexico.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-it-Mean-When-Mexico-Surrenders"><a href="#What-Does-it-Mean-When-Mexico-Surrenders" class="headerlink" title="What Does it Mean When Mexico Surrenders?"></a>What Does it Mean When Mexico Surrenders?</h1><p>The Mexican-American War was a conflict that took place in the 1840s between Mexico and the United States. The war began after the U.S. annexed Texas, which Mexico claimed as its own territory.</p>
<p>In 1846, the U.S. invaded Mexico and quickly captured control of most of the country. In early 1847, the Mexican forces suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Monterrey, and soon after, Mexican President José Joaquín de Herrera decided to surrender to the U.S.</p>
<p>The terms of surrender were negotiated by Nicholas Trist, an agent for President James K. Polk. Under the terms of surrender, Mexico agreed to cede Texas and California to the United States, as well as pay $15 million in compensation.</p>
<p>The treaty was ratified by both countries in early 1848 and ended the war. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is often regarded as one of the most lopsided treaties in American history, as it resulted in the United States acquiring a large amount of territory from Mexico for a relatively small price.</p>

This might include wages, self-employment income, interest, dividends, and royalty income. It can also be used to report payments received for services performed by independent contractors. Gambling Winnings are also reportable on a 1099 misc.</p>
<p>If you received a 1099 misc instead of a W2-G for gambling wins, don’t worry. The IRS will still expect you to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. The 1099 misc just provides more detail about the specific amounts that were paid to you.</p>
<p>You should still report all of your gambling winnings on line 21 of your Form 1040, regardless of whether you receive a 1099 misc or a W2-G. Be sure to include any losses as well. You can use Schedule A to itemize your deductions and claim your gambling losses as a deduction.</p>
<h1 id="Could-I-Get-Away-With-Not-Reporting-My-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Could-I-Get-Away-With-Not-Reporting-My-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Could I Get Away With Not Reporting My Gambling Winnings?"></a>Could I Get Away With Not Reporting My Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>You may be wondering if you’re required to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. The answer is: it depends.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick guide to help you figure out if you need to report your gambling winnings and, if so, how much you need to pay in taxes.</p>
<p>Are Gambling Winnings Taxable?</p>
<p>Generally, gambling winnings are taxable income. This means that you must report them on your tax return and pay taxes on the amount you won.</p>
<p>However, there are a few exceptions. For example, if you win a prize in a contest or sweepstakes, the winnings are not taxable.</p>
<p>And, as with most things tax-related, there are a few exceptions to the rule that gambling winnings are taxable income. So be sure to check with a tax professional if you have any questions about whether or not you need to report your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>How Much Do I Need to Pay in Taxes on My Gambling Winnings?</p>
<p>The amount of taxes you need to pay on your gambling winnings depends on how much money you won.</p>
<p>For example, if you won $1,200 in gambling proceeds, you would need to report the entire $1,200 as taxable income on your tax return. And, depending on your tax bracket, you would likely owe around $240 in taxes on that amount.</p>
<p>However, if you only won a few bucks playing slots at the casino, the amount of taxes you owe on those winnings would be very small – or even zero.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if you lose money gambling, you can’t claim those losses as a deduction on your tax return. Only gambling winnings are taxable income.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-1099-Misc-Better-Than-the-W2-G-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Is-the-1099-Misc-Better-Than-the-W2-G-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Is the 1099 Misc Better Than the W2-G for Gambling Winnings?"></a>Is the 1099 Misc Better Than the W2-G for Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>When it comes to reporting gambling winnings, there are two common types of forms you may receive from a casino: the 1099 Misc and the W2-G. Both forms have their own benefits and drawbacks, so which one is the best for you?</p>
<p>The 1099 Misc is an annual statement issued by businesses to those who have received at least $600 in income during the year. This form is used for a variety of purposes, including reporting gambling winnings. The W2-G, on the other hand, is specifically designed for reporting gambling winnings and is only issued when winnings exceed $1,200.</p>
<p>So which form should you use? The answer depends on a few factors, including how much you’ve won and your tax bracket.</p>
<p>If you’re in a lower tax bracket, then the 1099 Misc may be better for you because it allows you to claim your gambling losses as deductions. This can help reduce your taxable income, which could lead to a lower tax bill. However, if you’re in a higher tax bracket, then the W2-G may be more beneficial because it offers a higher deduction limit.</p>
<p>In addition, the W2-G includes information about your payout amount and the amount you wagered, which can help with tax preparation. So if you want simplicity and ease of use, the W2-G may be better for you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, choosing between the 1099 Misc and the W2-G depends on your individual tax situation. However, both forms have their own benefits and drawbacks, so it’s important to understand what each one entails before deciding which one to use.</p>
<h1 id="Which-One-Is-Better-The-1099-Misc-or-the-W2-G-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Which-One-Is-Better-The-1099-Misc-or-the-W2-G-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Which One Is Better: The 1099 Misc or the W2-G for Gambling Winnings?"></a>Which One Is Better: The 1099 Misc or the W2-G for Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>In order to answer this question, it is important to first understand the differences between the 1099 Misc and the W2-G.</p>
<p>The 1099 Misc is used for reporting payments to independent contractors, while the W2-G is used for gambling winnings. The 1099 Misc is also used for other types of payments, such as rents, royalties, and services rendered.</p>
<p>The W2-G is used to report gambling winnings of $600 or more. Gambling winnings encompass not just casino games, but also lotteries, horse races, and other bets or wagers. Payment of $600 or more must be reported on a W2-G, even if the winnings are later reimbursed.</p>
<p>There are a few key differences between the 1099 Misc and the W2-G. First, the 1099 Misc is issued to the payee, while the W2-G is issued to the IRS. Second, the 1099 Misc does not include Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from wages, while the W2-G does. Finally, the 1099 Misc may be used for other types of payments in addition to gambling winnings, while the W2-G can only be used for gambling winnings.</p>
<p>Now that we have a better understanding of the two forms, let’s compare and contrast them further. The main advantage of using a 1099 Misc is that it is less paperwork for both you and your payee. There is no need to file a separate W2-G with your tax return; instead simply report all of your income (including gambling winnings) on Line 7 of your Form 1040 Schedule C. This can save you time and hassle come tax time.</p>
<p>Another advantage of using a 1099 Misc is that it allows you to report taxable income in whichever year it was actually earned, rather than when it was paid out. For example, if you receive a payment in January 2019 but did not cash it until December 2019, you would report that payment on your 2019 tax return even though it was technically received in 2020. This can be helpful if you have taxable income from other sources in addition to gambling winnings.</p>
<p>However, there are also some disadvantages to using a 1099 Misc. First, if you fail to report any gambling income on your return (even if it was reported on a 1099 Misc), you could face penalties from the IRS. Second, because you are responsible for collecting and reporting Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld from wages on a 1099 Misc (but not on a W2-G), you may end up owing those taxes if they were not withheld properly by your payer. Finally, because each payment must be tracked separately on a 1099 Misc (rather than all being reported on one form), this can be more time consuming and difficult than using a W2-G.</p>
<p>So which one should you use? It depends on your individual circumstances. If you are expecting to receive $600 or more in gambling winnings during the year, then you should use a W2-G instead of a 1099 Misc. However, if your gambling income falls below $600 or if you are reporting other types of payments in addition to gambling winnings (rents, royalties, services rendered), then using a1099 Misc may be more convenient for you.”</p>

This means that you are obligated to report any gambling winnings on your tax return, even if you receive a 1099 Misc.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are deductions available to offset some of the taxes you may owe on your gambling winnings. For example, you can deduct gambling losses up to the amount of your gambling winnings. In addition, you can deduct certain costs associated with gambling, such as transportation and food expenses.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep track of your gambling-related expenses, as they can help reduce your tax liability. If you don’t have documentation for your expenses, you may still be able to claim a deduction by estimating the amount you spent. However, it’s always best to keep detailed records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your income and deductions.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to report your gambling income and deductions, please consult a tax professional.</p>

They can also lead to broken families and financial disaster.</p>
<p>When someone becomes addicted to casino games, they will often lose touch with reality. They will stop caring about their family, friends, work, or anything else in their life. All they will care about is gambling and trying to win more money.</p>
<p>Some people become so addicted that they will spend every penny they have on casino games. This can lead to them becoming homeless or even bankrupt. They may also turn to crime in order to get money to gamble with.</p>
<p>The effects of casino addiction can be devastating for families. The addict may start lying or cheating on their partner, which can lead to arguments and breakups. The addict’s children may also suffer, as they may not get the attention they need from their parents. This can lead to problems such as depression or behavioural issues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, casino games are very dangerous and ruin the lives of many people. If you are addicted to them, please get help before it’s too late!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-games-are-rigged-and-unfair"><a href="#Casino-games-are-rigged-and-unfair" class="headerlink" title="Casino games are rigged and unfair!"></a>Casino games are rigged and unfair!</h1><p>Casino games are rigged and unfair. This is a fact that has been proven time and again by players and experts alike. Casinos have been caught cheating and rigging games in their favor, time and again.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that casino games are not fair, and you are highly likely to lose money in the long run if you play them. So if you want to have any chance of winning, it’s best to stay away from casinos altogether.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-are-only-out-to-take-your-money"><a href="#Casinos-are-only-out-to-take-your-money" class="headerlink" title="Casinos are only out to take your money!"></a>Casinos are only out to take your money!</h1><p>In any casino, there is one goal and one goal only – to take your money. The games are rigged so that the casino always comes out on top.</p>
<p>If you believe otherwise, then you are in for a rude awakening. The fact of the matter is that casinos make their profits through clever mathematical manipulations of the games they offer.</p>
<p>This means that in order to have any chance of winning, you need to be well versed in probability and statistics. Even then, the odds are stacked against you.</p>
<p>One popular game found in most casinos is roulette. In this game, there are 38 numbers on the wheel and players can bet on a single number or a range of numbers.</p>
<p>The casino has a house edge of 2.7%. This may not sound like much but it adds up over time. For example, if you bet $1 on each spin of the roulette wheel, then the casino will take $27 from you over the course of 100 spins.</p>
<p>This is why casinos are only out to take your money – because that is how they make their profits!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-is-a-waste-of-time-and-money"><a href="#Gambling-is-a-waste-of-time-and-money" class="headerlink" title="Gambling is a waste of time and money!"></a>Gambling is a waste of time and money!</h1><p>Gambling is often seen as a fun and harmless pastime, but the reality is that gambling can be addictive and destructive. Gambling can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even criminal activity.</p>
<p>Gambling is designed to make money for the casinos and gambling operators. The odds are always stacked against the player, meaning that the house always wins in the long run. This means that players are almost certain to lose money over time if they gamble.</p>
<p>Some people believe that they can beat the odds and make money through gambling. This is simply not possible, as the casinos have many ways of ensuring that they make a profit. The only people who make money from gambling are the owners of the casinos themselves.</p>
<p>There are many other activities that provide just as much (or more) fun than gambling, without the associated risks. These activities include things like playing sports, going to concerts or watching movies. So why waste your time and money on gambling when there are so many better alternatives available?</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-can-lead-to-addiction-and-ruin-your-life"><a href="#Gambling-can-lead-to-addiction-and-ruin-your-life" class="headerlink" title="Gambling can lead to addiction and ruin your life!"></a>Gambling can lead to addiction and ruin your life!</h1><p>Gambling is often seen as a fun, harmless pastime but it can actually lead to addiction and ruin your life. Gambling can be very addictive, with some people unable to resist the temptation to gamble even when they know it could ruin them financially.</p>
<p>Gambling can also have a negative impact on your mental health, leading to anxiety, depression and other problems. It can be very damaging to relationships too, as gambling can take up a lot of time and money that could be spent on loved ones.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome their addiction, including support groups and therapy.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Nevada-Gaming-Commission-to-Regulate-Computer-Gambling-in-Blackjack-Rooms"><a href="#Nevada-Gaming-Commission-to-Regulate-Computer-Gambling-in-Blackjack-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gaming Commission to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms"></a>Nevada Gaming Commission to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has announced that it would start regulating computer gambling in blackjack rooms. The commission is specifically targeting the use of bots, which are computer programs that play blackjack and other casino games.</p>
<p>Regulating computer gambling could prove to be a challenge for the commission. For one, bots can be programmed to behave in ways that are difficult to detect. They can also make split-second decisions that human players cannot. As a result, it may be difficult for casino staff to determine whether a particular player is using a bot or not.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no foolproof way to prevent people from using bots. Some people may simply choose to ignore the regulations and find ways to use bots anyway.</p>
<p>There are also concerns that regulating computer gambling could negatively impact the gaming industry. If bots are able to consistently win money against human players, people may start avoiding blackjack and other casino games altogether. This could lead to fewer people playing these games, and ultimately less revenue for casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Computer-Regulation-Signed-by-Nevada-Governor"><a href="#Blackjack-Computer-Regulation-Signed-by-Nevada-Governor" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Computer Regulation Signed by Nevada Governor"></a>Blackjack Computer Regulation Signed by Nevada Governor</h1><p>Governor Brian Sandoval has signed a bill into law regulating the playing of blackjack by computers. The new law, SB 228, allows casinos in Nevada to use computer programs to play the game, as long as certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>One of the main purposes of the new law is to ensure that casino patrons have a fair chance against the computer. To that end, the law prohibits casinos from using programs that are overly advantageous to the house. In addition, casinos must make the computer playing program available to players for inspection.</p>
<p>The new law takes effect on October 1, 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Computer-Regulations-a-Win-for-Casinos-and-Gamblers-Alike"><a href="#Blackjack-Computer-Regulations-a-Win-for-Casinos-and-Gamblers-Alike" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Computer Regulations a Win for Casinos and Gamblers Alike"></a>Blackjack Computer Regulations a Win for Casinos and Gamblers Alike</h1><p>The regulation of blackjack computer use by casinos in the United States may seem like a negative for gamblers, but it is really a win-win situation for both the casinos and the players.</p>
<p>Players who use computers to help them beat the casino will no longer be able to do so as the new regulations prohibit their use. Casinos, on the other hand, can now be confident that their games are fair and that players are not using any outside help to beat them. This protects their profits and ensures that players are not taking unfair advantage of the casino.</p>
<p>Aside from being fair to both casinos and players, these regulations are also good for the economy. They create jobs in the casino industry and help to keep money within our borders rather than going to foreign casinos.</p>
<p>So, while some may see these new regulations as a negative, I believe that they are actually a positive development for all involved.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Officials-Gear-Up-to-Regulate-Computer-Gambling-in-Blackjack-Rooms"><a href="#Nevada-Officials-Gear-Up-to-Regulate-Computer-Gambling-in-Blackjack-Rooms" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Officials Gear Up to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms"></a>Nevada Officials Gear Up to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission is considering a proposal that would allow regulated computer gambling in blackjack rooms. The proposed regulation would set rules for the use of computerized devices to play blackjack in live dealer gaming environments.</p>
<p>If approved, the regulation would require Nevada casino operators to install computerized blackjack tables in at least 10% of their live dealer gaming areas. The devices would only be allowed to be used by players who are seated at the table, and all games would be conducted under the watch of a human dealer.</p>
<p>In introducing the proposal, Commission chairman Tony Alamo said, “We believe that this type of game will provide a new level of excitement and entertainment for our customers, while also providing an additional option for our gaming operators.”</p>
<p>Some industry observers are skeptical about the proposal, however. They argue that the added convenience of using a computer may not be enough to overcome the fact that players are still playing against other people at a physical table.</p>
<p>Others contend that allowing computer gambling could create security risks, as well as concerns about fairness and accuracy. There is also some concern that the introduction of such devices could cannibalize business from traditional blackjack tables.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Computers-to-be-Regulated-by-Gaming-Licensing-Boards"><a href="#Blackjack-Computers-to-be-Regulated-by-Gaming-Licensing-Boards" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Computers to be Regulated by Gaming Licensing Boards"></a>Blackjack Computers to be Regulated by Gaming Licensing Boards</h1><p>In the wake of the popular release of the blackjack computer, gaming licensing boards around the world have been racing to draft regulations for their use.</p>
<p>The devices, which typically consist of a small computer and concealed card-reading hardware, allow players to track the cards that have been dealt and make strategic decisions accordingly. This gives them a significant edge over other players, particularly in traditional casino settings where human dealers are used.</p>
<p>As a result, many gaming boards are now seeking to prohibit their use in casinos, or at least restrict their deployment to certain areas of the casino floor. In addition, they are also looking at ways to levy fines and penalties against people caught using blackjack computers.</p>
<p>“The use of blackjack computers fundamentally alters the playing field in casinos and gives an unfair advantage to those using them,” said one board spokesperson. “We need to take steps to ensure that our casinos remain fair and competitive places for all players.”</p>
<p>However, not everyone agrees with this approach. Some industry observers feel that the regulation of blackjack computers is unnecessary and will only serve to hamper innovation in the industry.</p>
<p>“These devices have been around for years and have never caused any real problems,” said one observer. “The fact is that they can be used by both skilled and unskilled players, so why should we single them out?”</p>
<p>Regardless of which side of the argument you fall on, it is clear that blackjack computers are here to stay – and that gaming licensing boards will be playing a key role in regulating their use from now on.</p>

The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing blackjack and craps when she hit the big win.</p>
<p>This is not the first big win for the woman – in fact, it’s her third major jackpot from playing at Jet Casino. She says that she enjoys the thrill of the games and the chance to win big payouts.</p>
<p>“I have always loved casino games, so I am really enjoying playing at Jet Casino. The wins have been amazing and I can’t wait to see what else the site has in store for me!”</p>
<p>Jet Casino is a popular online casino that offers players a range of exciting games to choose from, including slots, blackjack, craps and roulette. There are also a range of bonuses available, including a 100% match bonus on first deposits.</p>
<h1 id="Man-loses-1-million-in-online-Jet-casino"><a href="#Man-loses-1-million-in-online-Jet-casino" class="headerlink" title="Man loses $1 million in online Jet casino"></a>Man loses $1 million in online Jet casino</h1><p>Mark Joseph lost $1 million in two days while playing casino games on Jet.com, a site he thought was affiliated with the well-known retailer of the same name.</p>
<p>“I just thought it was a cool site because I could shop while I played,” said Mr. Joseph, 38 years old, of Yonkers, N.Y. “I had no idea it was an online casino.”</p>
<p>He says he deposited $500 on Monday and then kept playing blackjack, roulette and other games, losing more than $1 million by Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Jet.com said the site doesn’t have a casino and that the games were likely provided by a third party. The spokesman said the company is working to refund Mr. Joseph’s money.</p>
<p>Online casinos are big business, with an estimated revenue of $4.5 billion in 2018, up from $3.5 billion in 2017, according to research by Juniper Research. Players can lose large sums of money quickly if they’re not careful.</p>
<p>In March, a man in his 70s from New Jersey lost $1 million playing slot machines on an unlicensed website he found through Google, according to local media reports. In December 2017, a woman from London lost about £1 million after gambling on her phone for 12 hours straight, according to British media reports.</p>
<p>Experts say people should be careful when choosing an online casino and make sure it is licensed and regulated by a reputable body such as the Malta Gaming Authority or the United Kingdom Gambling Commission. They also say people should stick to gambling within their means and not try to win back money they have already lost.—The Wall Street Journal</p>
<h1 id="Police-raid-home-of-online-Jet-casino-user"><a href="#Police-raid-home-of-online-Jet-casino-user" class="headerlink" title="Police raid home of online Jet casino user"></a>Police raid home of online Jet casino user</h1><p>Police from the state of Victoria in Australia have raided the home of an online casino user as part of an ongoing investigation into illegal gambling.</p>
<p>The raid took place on Monday morning and involved officers from the Victoria Police Sporting Integrity Intelligence Unit, as well as members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP).</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Victoria Police, the raid was carried out as part of an investigation into “illegal gambling and money laundering”.</p>
<p>No arrests were made during the raid, but a number of items were seized including computers, mobile phones, and documentation.</p>
<p>“The AFP will allege that these items are associated with suspected offences under Commonwealth law pertaining to illegal gambling and money laundering,” said AFP Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan.</p>
<p>“This activity is a priority for the AFP and we will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle any organised criminal networks who seek to profit from illegal activities.”</p>
<p>While it has not been confirmed which online casino was being targeted by the police raid, it is believed that they may have been targeting users of Jet Casino.</p>
<p>Jet Casino is an online casino that is licensed in Malta and operated by Betsson Group. The site offers a range of casino games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and bingo.</p>
<p>It is not clear if any charges will be laid as a result of Monday’s raid, but the Victoria Police said that they “will continue to investigate this matter”.</p>
<h1 id="Man-gets-5-year-jail-sentence-for-online-Jet-casino-use"><a href="#Man-gets-5-year-jail-sentence-for-online-Jet-casino-use" class="headerlink" title="Man gets 5-year jail sentence for online Jet casino use"></a>Man gets 5-year jail sentence for online Jet casino use</h1><p>An Australian man has been sentenced to five years in jail for using an online Jet casino. The 46-year-old was convicted of using the site to gamble more than $1.4 million AUD over a period of 18 months.</p>
<p>The defendant denied the charges, but Justice John Burns didn’t believe him and handed down the sentence earlier this week. In his ruling, Burns said that the defendant had shown a “flagrant disregard” for the law and displayed no remorse for his actions.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time an Australian has been convicted of using an online casino. In fact, it’s become something of a trend in recent years as authorities crack down on illegal gambling activity. Late last year, two men were sentenced to prison after being caught using an illegal online casino.</p>
<p>So why are online casinos such a big target for authorities? The answer is simple: they can be used to launder money. Because online casinos are based offshore, it’s relatively easy for criminals to move money around without being detected. This makes them a perfect tool for laundering money, which is why authorities are taking such a strong stance against them.</p>
<p>In addition to the five-year jail sentence, the Australian man was also ordered to pay back $1.4 million AUD in winnings. This is just one more example of how serious authorities are about tackling illegal gambling activity.</p>

In this case, using a basic blackjack strategy can actually hurt your chances of winning rather than help.</p>
<p>To understand why this is the case, we first need to take a look at how the Azure dealer works. When playing against an Azure dealer, the game uses a six-deck shoe. The dealer will always stand on 17 and hit on 16. In addition, when the player has a score of -1.5, the dealer will also hit on 16. This means that the player’s best option in this situation is to stand instead of hit.</p>
<p> By standing, you are essentially forcing the dealer to draw another card. Since the dealer must hit on 16, there is a good chance that they will bust and end up with a score of 17 or more. This gives you a better chance of winning than if you had chosen to hit yourself.</p>
<p>While basic blackjack strategy can be helpful in other situations, it can actually hurt your chances of winning when faced with an Azure dealer and a score of -1.5. In this case, it is best to stand and let the dealer take another card.</p>

The popularity of casinos has ebbed and flowed throughout the years, but they remain a popular destination for people looking to gamble.</p>
<p>The casino industry is worth billions of dollars, and there are several reasons for this. Casinos offer a wide range of games that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. They also offer a social atmosphere where people can come together and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Many people also enjoy the excitement and thrill of gambling. Casinos offer a wide variety of games that can provide this excitement, including blackjack, poker, and slot machines. These games are all designed to give players the chance to win big payouts.</p>
<p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and offers some of the best odds for players. In blackjack, players compete against the dealer to see who can get closest to 21 without going over. The game pays out at -1.5 when playing against the Azure dealer, making it one of the best games to play in a casino.</p>

<li><p>The aim of the game is to beat the dealer, not get as close to 21 as possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your first two cards are an Ace and a ten-value card, (a blackjack), you automatically win regardless of the dealer’s hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In most variants of blackjack, the player may also place a side bet known as an insurance bet. This bet wins if the dealer has a blackjack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re playing at an online casino like Azure, and find yourself in the unfortunate position of being down 1.5 chips, don’t worry – there are still ways to win. The aim of blackjack is to beat the dealer, not get as close to 21 as possible, so remember that even if your score is low, you can still win if the dealer goes bust.</p>
<p>If your first two cards are an Ace and a ten-value card, (a blackjack), you automatically win regardless of the dealer’s hand. In most variants of blackjack, the player may also place a side bet known as an insurance bet. This bet wins if the dealer has a blackjack. So if you’re dealt two aces for your first two cards, make sure to place an insurance bet – it could be your ticket to winning back what you’ve lost so far.</p>

In this article we will go over some tips for gambling against the Azure dealer when the blackjack score is -1.5.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember when gambling against the Azure dealer is that they are very consistent in their play. They will rarely make any mistakes, so you need to be on your toes at all times. Secondly, always remember that the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The Azure dealer will always take another card if their score is below 17, so it’s important to keep track of their score.</p>
<p>If the Azure dealer has a score of between 2 and 6, you should hit if you have a score of between 12 and 16. If you have a score of between 6 and 11, you should stand. If the Azure dealer has a score of 7 or 8, you should hit if you have a score of 13 or 14. If you have a score of 9 or 10, you should stand. And finally, if the Azure dealer has a score of 9 or 10, you should hit if you have a score of 15 or 16.</p>
<p>If the Azure dealer has a score of between 17 and 20, you should stand no matter what your own score is. And finally, if the Azure dealer has a score of 21 or more, you should never take another card no matter what your own score is.</p>
<p>By following these tips and playing smartly, you can give yourself a better chance at winning against the Azure dealer when the blackjack score is -1.5</p>

The Jazz were as +7 underdogs according to gambling odds before the game, but they proved that they are a team to be reckoned with in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Rockets came into the game with the best record in the league, but the Jazz were not intimidated. They matched Houston’s firepower, outscoring them in three of four quarters. Donovan Mitchell led the way for Utah with 27 points, while Rudy Gobert added 21 points and 16 rebounds.</p>
<p>Houston was led by James Harden’s 34 points, but Chris Paul was held to just 12 points on 3-of-14 shooting. The Jazz’s defense was able to slow down Paul and keep him from having a big impact on the game.</p>
<p>This upset is a sign of things to come for the Jazz. They have a young and talented roster that is only going to get better as they continue to grow together. With Gobert and Mitchell leading the way, they can compete with anyone in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Rockets still have the best record in the league, but this loss shows that they are not invincible. Other teams in the Western Conference should take note and be prepared for a tough matchup when they face off against Utah.</p>
<h1 id="Donovan-Mitchell-and-Rudy-Gobert-Lead-Utah-Jazz-to-Huge-Victory-in-Gambling"><a href="#Donovan-Mitchell-and-Rudy-Gobert-Lead-Utah-Jazz-to-Huge-Victory-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert Lead Utah Jazz to Huge Victory in Gambling"></a>Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert Lead Utah Jazz to Huge Victory in Gambling</h1><p>The Utah Jazz played an amazing game against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Donovan Mitchell led the team to a huge victory, with 29 points and 10 rebounds. Rudy Gobert also had an incredible game, with 25 points and 18 rebounds.</p>
<p>The Warriors are one of the best teams in the NBA, but the Jazz outplayed them from start to finish. The Utah defense was tough, and they were able to force turnovers and score easy baskets.</p>
<p>Mitchell and Gobert are two of the most talented players in the league, and they showed why they are such a dangerous team. The Jazz have now won six of their last seven games, and they appear to be headed for the playoffs.</p>
<p>Gambling experts are starting to take note of the Utah Jazz, and they are now considered one of the top teams in the NBA. They have a strong starting lineup, and their bench is also very deep.</p>
<p>This is a young team that is only going to get better as the season progresses. Mitchell is already one of the best players in the league, and he is only going to get better with experience.</p>
<p>The Utah Jazz are definitely a team to watch out for in the future. They have already shown that they can compete with any team in the NBA, and they should be a threat in the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Jazz-Surge-Past-Rockets-in-Overtime-Thriller-in-Gambling"><a href="#Jazz-Surge-Past-Rockets-in-Overtime-Thriller-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Jazz Surge Past Rockets in Overtime Thriller in Gambling"></a>Jazz Surge Past Rockets in Overtime Thriller in Gambling</h1><p>A see-saw game that came down to the wire and went into overtime, the Houston Rockets looked to have the Jazz beaten, but Utah had other ideas. With an impressive comeback in a high scoring game, Jazz surge past Rockets in overtime thriller in gambling.</p>
<p>Houston Rockets’ James Harden had an amazing first half of the game, scoring 37 points by halftime. However, the Jazz defense tightened up in the second half, led by rookie Donovan Mitchell who had 26 points. The Rockets were up 114-109 with 3:14 left in regulation before Joe Ingles hit a 3 pointer to start a 5-0 Utah run. Ingles then tied the game at 114 on a layup with 11 seconds left to send it into overtime.</p>
<p>In overtime, Jae Crowder hit a big 3 pointer to give Utah a 119-114 lead, and they would not look back. Rudy Gobert led all players with 28 points and 20 rebounds as the Jazz won 128-118. With this victory, Utah improves to 12-11 on the season while Houston falls to 13-10.</p>
<p>This was an important win for Utah as they continue their playoff push in the Western Conference. They now sit just 1 ½ games back of the 8th seed Rockets and will need more performances like this if they want to make it into postseason play.</p>
<h1 id="Utah-Jazz-Earn-Statement-Win-Against-Houston-Rockets-in-Gambling"><a href="#Utah-Jazz-Earn-Statement-Win-Against-Houston-Rockets-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Utah Jazz Earn Statement Win Against Houston Rockets in Gambling"></a>Utah Jazz Earn Statement Win Against Houston Rockets in Gambling</h1><p>The Utah Jazz hosted the Houston Rockets in a matchup of two of the best teams in the Western Conference. The Rockets have been one of the most surprising teams in the league this year, but the Jazz were able to earn a statement win with a 116-108 victory.</p>
<p>The game was close for much of the contest, but Utah was able to pull away in the fourth quarter. Donovan Mitchell led the way for Utah with 29 points and 10 assists, while Rudy Gobert added 26 points and 14 rebounds. James Harden had a triple-double for Houston with 36 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Jazz.</p>
<p>This was a huge win for Utah as they continue to fight for one of the top spots in the West. They now have a three-game lead over Houston for third place in the conference, and they will look to build on this momentum as they head into the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Fans-Left-Wondering-How-Good-Utah-Jazz-Actually-Are-After-Impressive-Gambling-Performance"><a href="#Oklahoma-City-Thunder-Fans-Left-Wondering-How-Good-Utah-Jazz-Actually-Are-After-Impressive-Gambling-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma City Thunder Fans Left Wondering How Good Utah Jazz Actually Are After Impressive Gambling Performance"></a>Oklahoma City Thunder Fans Left Wondering How Good Utah Jazz Actually Are After Impressive Gambling Performance</h1><p>In what might be one of the most stunning turnarounds in NBA history, the Utah Jazz went from being a 14-point underdog to defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Jazz were listed as sizable favorites against the Thunder on NBA gambling odds, but they turned in an unexpectedly dominant performance to pull off the upset.</p>
<p>Now, OKC fans are left wondering how good Utah actually is.</p>
<p>On one hand, you could say that this was just a lucky win for Utah and that they won’t be able to repeat it against better teams.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, you could argue that this game shows that the Jazz are for real and have what it takes to compete with anyone in the league.</p>
<p>What’s clear is that Wednesday’s game was definitely not something that OKC fans saw coming. The Thunder were coming off of a big win over the Golden State Warriors and were expected to easily take care of the Jazz.</p>
<p>But instead, Utah came out firing on all cylinders and never let up. Rudy Gobert was a force down low and Donovan Mitchell led the way offensively.</p>
<p>Russell Westbrook had a triple-double for OKC, but it wasn’t enough to overcome Utah’s dominance.</p>
<p>So now Thunder fans are left wondering where their team stands in relation to the rest of the NBA. Are they contenders or pretenders?</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: Wednesday’s game was definitely a surprising outcome that no one saw coming.</p>

If so, you may be able to write off a portion of your expenses on your tax return.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has confirmed that gamers who pay for subscriptions to gaming services such as Xbox Live and Playstation Plus may be eligible to claim a $1,000 deduction on their taxes.</p>
<p>To qualify, taxpayers must provide proof that they paid for the subscription in question with after-tax dollars. They must also demonstrate that the subscription was used primarily for “entertainment, amusement or recreation” purposes.</p>
<p>In order to claim the deduction, taxpayers must list the cost of the subscription on line 21 of Form 1040, under “Other Miscellaneous Deductions”. Note that only expenditures that exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) are deductible. So if your AGI is $50,000, for example, you can only deduct expenses that exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>This new development could be great news for avid gamers across the country. The deduction is sure to come as a relief to those who have been struggling to make ends meet in light of recent tax increases.</p>
<p>So don’t forget – if you’re an adventure gamer and you have receipts to prove it, be sure to claim your $1,000 deduction when you file your taxes this year!</p>
<h1 id="Fun-New-Way-To-Lower-Your-taxable-income"><a href="#Fun-New-Way-To-Lower-Your-taxable-income" class="headerlink" title="Fun New Way To Lower Your taxable income"></a>Fun New Way To Lower Your taxable income</h1><p>There are several new and innovative ways to lower your taxable income without breaking any rules. While many of these methods are not well known, they can be helpful in reducing your tax burden.</p>
<p>One such method is to make charitable contributions. Qualified donations to approved charities can provide you with a valuable tax deduction. However, it is important to note that not all donations are created equal. You need to be sure that the charity you are contributing to is a registered 501(c)(3) organization. If it is not, your contribution will not be tax deductible.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce your taxable income is by investing in municipal bonds. These bonds offer tax-exempt interest, which can save you money on your taxes. Municipal bonds also tend to have low interest rates, making them a more affordable investment option.</p>
<p>A third option for lowering your taxable income is through the use of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). HSAs allow you to save pre-tax money for qualified medical expenses. This can be a great way to reduce your taxable income while also building up savings for future health costs.</p>
<p>There are many other strategies that can be used to reduce your taxable income. By exploring these options and implementing those that are most advantageous to you, you can keep more of your hard-earned money in your pocket.</p>
<h1 id="Enjoy-The-Adventure-Game-amp-Get-A-little-tax-relief-too"><a href="#Enjoy-The-Adventure-Game-amp-Get-A-little-tax-relief-too" class="headerlink" title="Enjoy The Adventure Game &amp; Get A little tax relief too!"></a>Enjoy The Adventure Game &amp; Get A little tax relief too!</h1><p>Do you like to play video games? How about getting a little tax relief while doing it? Many video games can be considered as a deductible expense on your taxes.</p>
<p>In order for a video game purchase to be tax deductible, the game must meet two requirements. First, the game must be for personal use and not for resale. Second, the game must generally have an entertainment purpose. This purpose can be found in many games, including but not limited to: racing games, puzzle games, and strategy games.</p>
<p>A deduction is allowed for the cost of the game regardless of whether it was purchased new or used. The deduction is also allowed even if you received the game as a gift. In order to claim the deduction, you will need to report the amount of the purchase on Form 1040, Schedule A as a Miscellaneous Deduction. The total miscellaneous deductions cannot exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when claiming this deduction. First, you can only deduct expenses that have been paid during the tax year. If you have not yet made a purchase, then you cannot claim it on your current year’s taxes. Secondly, you cannot claim expenses that have been reimbursed by your employer. Finally, certain hobby expenses are not allowed as tax deductions. Video game playing is generally considered a hobby and not a business activity so most players will be able to claim their video game expenses without any issues.</p>
<p>So get out there and start gaming! Not only are you Tax Relief eligible but now you can save some money on your taxes too!</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Savings-From-Playing-Adventure-Game"><a href="#Tax-Savings-From-Playing-Adventure-Game" class="headerlink" title="Tax Savings From Playing Adventure Game"></a>Tax Savings From Playing Adventure Game</h1><p>Tax season is creeping up on us and it’s time to start thinking about how you can save money on your taxes. One way to reduce your taxable income is by taking advantage of tax breaks related to your hobbies. Here we will discuss how playing adventure games can help you reduce your tax bill.</p>
<p>First, what is an adventure game? An adventure game, according to Merriam-Webster, is “a game in which the player must use skill and intelligence to solve a series of puzzles or problems in order to advance.” This includes video games such as the popular “Pokemon Go” but also traditional pen-and-paper games such as “Dungeons and Dragons.”</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why playing adventure games can help you save money on your taxes. First, many adventure games qualify as educational expenses. This means that you can deduct the costs of buying the game, equipment needed for play, and even subscription fees from your taxable income. Second, adventure games can be used for entertainment purposes, which means that you can deduct associated costs from your taxable income as well. Finally, playing these games can help you maintain mental fitness, which may allow you to claim a deduction for medical expenses related to your hobby.</p>
<p>All in all, there are a number of ways that playing adventure games can help reduce your tax bill this year. So get out there and start slaying dragons or catching ‘em all – and rest assured that you’re doing something good for your bottom line too!</p>
