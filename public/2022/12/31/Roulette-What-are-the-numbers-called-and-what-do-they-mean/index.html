This means that you are betting on a particular number to come up. The numbers on the wheel are:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.</p>
<p>There is also a green 0 and a red 00 on the wheel. These are called the “zeros”.</p>
<p>When you make a straight up bet on a number, you are betting that that particular number will come up. If it does come up, you will win 36 times your original bet amount. So if you had bet $10 on a number and it came up as the winner, you would get back $360 (36 x $10).</p>
<p>However, if the number doesn’t come up (it’s “black” or “red”), you lose your original bet amount.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-about-roulette-number-calls-and-their-meanings"><a href="#Learn-about-roulette-number-calls-and-their-meanings" class="headerlink" title="Learn about roulette number calls and their meanings"></a>Learn about roulette number calls and their meanings</h1><p>In roulette, you can place bets on a variety of things, but the most common bets are on numbers. When placing a bet on a number, you’re essentially betting that the ball will end up on that number after it’s spun around the roulette wheel.</p>
<p>There are different types of bets that you can place on a number, and one of these is called a “number call.” This is a bet where you predict which number the ball will fall on out of a certain range of numbers. So, for example, if you think the ball will fall on either number 5 or 6, you would make a number call bet on those two numbers.</p>
<p>There are different types of number call bets, and each one has its own specific meaning. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most common ones.</p>
<p>Straight Up: A straight up bet is when you bet on a single number without any other added together. So, for example, if you wanted to bet on number 5, you would make a straight up bet on that number.</p>
<p>Split: A split is when you bet on two adjoining numbers by placing your chips between those two numbers. For example, if you wanted to bet on 17 and 18, you would place your chips between those two numbers on the betting grid.</p>
<p>Street: A street is when you bet on three consecutive numbers by placing your chips in the row between those three numbers. For example, if you wanted to bet on 12, 13 and 14, you would place your chips in the row between those three numbers.</p>
<p>Corner: A corner is when you bet on four adjoining numbers by placing your chips at the corner where those four numbers meet. For example, if you wanted to bet on 23, 24, 25 and 26, you would place your chips at the corner where those four numbers meet.</p>
<p>Six Line: A six line is when you bet on two adjacent streets by placing your chips at the intersection of those streets. For example, if you wanted to bet on 37 and 38 (the first two numbers in the second row), you would place your chips at the intersection of those two streets.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-know-the-roulette-call-for-each-number"><a href="#How-to-know-the-roulette-call-for-each-number" class="headerlink" title="How to know the roulette call for each number"></a>How to know the roulette call for each number</h1><p>This is a simple guide on how to know the roulette call for each number. </p>
<p>First, you need to understand how the roulette wheel works. The wheel has 36 numbers (1-36), and 18 of those are black and 18 are red. When the ball falls into a slot, that’s the number it is.  </p>
<p>Secondly, you need to learn about the different calls associated with each number. There are a variety of calls, but some of the more common ones are: Single, Double, Triple, Corner, Street, Six Line, and Column. </p>
<p>To figure out which call goes with which number on the wheel, simply match up the color of the slot the ball falls into with the color of the call. So for example, if single is called for red and black is called for odd numbers then number 17 on the wheel would be “single red”. </p>
<p>It can take some time to get used to all of the different calls, but once you know them it’s easy to place bets on your favorite numbers!</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-different-roulette-calls-mean"><a href="#What-do-the-different-roulette-calls-mean" class="headerlink" title="What do the different roulette calls mean?"></a>What do the different roulette calls mean?</h1><p>There are many different roulette calls that can be heard at a casino, but what do they all mean? In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most common ones and explain what they mean.</p>
<h1 id="“It’s-a-natural”"><a href="#“It’s-a-natural”" class="headerlink" title="“It’s a natural”"></a>“It’s a natural”</h1><p>This call is used when the ball lands in one of the slots that correspond to the player’s bet. For example, if you placed a bet on red and the ball landed in a red slot, the dealer would say “it’s a natural”. This means that you automatically win and your bet is paid out at even money.</p>
<h1 id="“No-more-bets”"><a href="#“No-more-bets”" class="headerlink" title="“No more bets”"></a>“No more bets”</h1><p>This call is used by the dealer to let players know that they can no longer place any bets. It’s usually used when there are only a few balls left in the shaker, or when there’s about to be a new shoe (in double-zero roulette).</p>
<h1 id="“Unlucky-number”"><a href="#“Unlucky-number”" class="headerlink" title="“Unlucky number”"></a>“Unlucky number”</h1><p>When the ball lands in a slot that doesn’t correspond to any of the player’s bets, the dealer may say “unlucky number”. This means that the player has lost their bet and their chips are taken away.</p>
<h1 id="Get-familiar-with-the-numbers-in-roulette-and-their-corresponding-calls"><a href="#Get-familiar-with-the-numbers-in-roulette-and-their-corresponding-calls" class="headerlink" title="Get familiar with the numbers in roulette and their corresponding calls"></a>Get familiar with the numbers in roulette and their corresponding calls</h1><p> Roulette is a casino game where players bet on the outcome of a spin of a wheel divided into 37 numbered slots. A small ball is dropped onto the spinning wheel and players gamble on which slot the ball will end up in. The numbers 1-36 are alternated with a green 0 and a red 00, making for a total of 38 potential winning outcomes.</p>
<p>Each number has a corresponding call, which is the name given to betting on that number. For example, betting on the number 5 would be called “betting on la cinq” in French or “volee 5” in Italian. In this article we will take you through each number and its corresponding call.</p>
<p>1 – Manque</p>
<p>This is French for “losing” and refers to when you bet on the number that comes up as losing. So if you bet on 1 and it comes up, you lose your bet.</p>
<p>2 – Passe</p>
<p>This is French for “passing” and refers to when you bet on the number that comes up as passing. So if you bet on 2 and it comes up, you win your bet.</p>
<p>3 –Premier trio</p>
<p>This is French for “first trio” and is a type of bet where you bet on whether the first two numbers that come up will be the same (like 12) or different (like 32). If they are different, then you win; if they are the same, then you lose. This type of bet pays out at 11:1 odds.</p>
<p>4 – Deuxieme trio</p>
<p>This is French for “second trio” and is similar to the premier trio except that it bets on the third number instead of the first two numbers. It also pays out at 11:1 odds.</p>
