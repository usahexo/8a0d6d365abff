Every now and then, an underdog team or individual comes out of nowhere to pull off a major upset against the odds.</p>
<p>In this article, we take a look at five of the biggest upsets in the history of sports betting.</p>
<p>#1 Buster Douglas beats Mike Tyson (1990)</p>
<p>Few could have predicted that 42-1 underdog Buster Douglas would knock out Mike Tyson in 1990. What made the upset all the more improbable was that Tyson was considered one of the most fearsome fighters in history.</p>
<p>#2 Greece beats Argentina (2004)</p>
<p>In one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, Greece beat Argentina 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the 2004 tournament. This result came as a complete surprise to most observers, as Argentina were heavy favourites going into the game.</p>
<p>#3 Leicester City wins Premier League (2015 – 2016)</p>
<p>Leicester City were 5000/1 outsiders to win the Premier League before the start of the 2015 – 2016 season. However, they defied all odds by clinching English football’s top prize after finishing 14th in the previous campaign.</p>
<p>#4 Appalachian State beats Michigan (2007)</p>
<p>The Appalachian State Mountaineers pulled off one of college football’s most famous upsets when they beat Michigan 34-32 in 2007. At the time, Michigan were ranked #5 in the country and Appalachian State were barely ranked at all.</p>
<p>#5 Villanova beats Georgetown (1985)<br>In one of college basketball’s most famous upsets, Villanova beat Georgetown 66-64 to win the 1985 national championship. The Wildcats were huge underdogs going into the game, with Georgetown being favoured by over 20 points</p>
<h1 id="The-5-most-controversial-500-sports-betting-decisions"><a href="#The-5-most-controversial-500-sports-betting-decisions" class="headerlink" title="The 5 most controversial 500 sports betting decisions"></a>The 5 most controversial 500 sports betting decisions</h1><ol>
<li>The Tuck Rule</li>
</ol>
<p>In what is perhaps the most controversial call in NFL history, the Tuck Rule was invoked to overturn a fumble by Patriots QB Tom Brady in a 2001 playoff game against the Raiders. While it’s arguable whether or not Brady actually lost the ball on the play, the rule states that a passer who is in the act of throwing the ball and loses possession due to an intentional forward movement of his arm is still considered to be in possession of the ball. The Patriots went on to win that game (and later the Super Bowl), thanks in large part to this disputed rule.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Immaculate Reception</li>
</ol>
<p>This one is still debated more than 40 years after it happened. In a 1972 playoff game between the Steelers and Raiders, Steelers QB Terry Bradshaw threw an errant pass that was scooped up by Raiders DB Jack Tatum. As Tatum bore down on Bradshaw, Raiders RB Franco Harris came flying in to make what appeared to be an illegal block, hitting Tatum and knocking him unconscious. The ball then bounced off Harris and into the hands of Steelers WR John “Frenchy” Fuqua, who ran it into the end zone for a touchdown. The play was ruled a catch and touchdown, giving the Steelers a 13-7 victory (and eventual trip to the Super Bowl). While most people consider it to be an immaculate reception, there are some who believe that Fuqua never actually caught the ball.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Henderson Touchdown</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the greatest moments in MLS history also happened to be one of its most controversial goals. With seconds remaining in overtime of MLS Cup 2002 and his team trailing 1-0, LA Galaxy striker Carlos Ruiz sent a long cross into the box towards teammate Nate Henderson. As Revolution goalkeeper Matt Reis lept out to try and make a save, Henderson reached up and headed the ball into the net for an iconic goal and championship-clinching victory. However, many people believe that Reis had already touched (and thus secured) the ball before Henderson made contact, which would have made it an invalid goal.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Goal Line Technology controversy<br>FIFA has been using goal line technology (voted for by football’s law-making body IFAB) since 2014, but controversies still flare up from time to time regarding disputed goal calls that were made with help from GLT systems. One such incident occurred during France’s 2018 World Cup quarterfinal match against Uruguay, when French midfielder Antoine Griezmann’s shot appeared to have crossed over the line but wasn’t given as a goal due to Uruguayan keeper Fernando Muslera getting his hand on it. This call sparked uproar among French fans (not to mention Griezmann himself) who felt that technology had robbed their team of what would have been a crucial goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>5 . Tiger Woods’ putt at 16 in The Masters Tournament<br>It’s possibly one of sport’s most famous moments - Tiger Woods holing his approach shot on 16th hole at Augusta National during The Masters tournament in 2005 en route to his first Green Jacket victory .  What’s less well known is that officials almost didn’t give him permission to take advantage of unprecedented leniency being shown by rules officials after he incurred two major penalties earlier in Round 3 .  Woods was allowed drop from where he hit his original shot after taking advice from playing partner Phil Mickelson , instead of dropping as originally required 50 yards back down the hole .</p>
<h1 id="The-5-best-players-in-500-sports-betting-history"><a href="#The-5-best-players-in-500-sports-betting-history" class="headerlink" title="The 5 best players in 500 sports betting history"></a>The 5 best players in 500 sports betting history</h1><p>There have been some incredible players in the history of sports betting, but these 5 stand out above all others.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first player on our list is Billy Walters. Walters is a legendary figure in sports betting and is considered by many to be the best ever. He has made millions of dollars betting on sports and is famed for his incredible knowledge of the game and his ability to spot value in the odds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next on our list is Jim Brown. Brown was one of the first great sports bettors and helped to set the standard for what it takes to be successful in this industry. He was known for his unmatched knowledge of NBA games and his uncanny ability to pick winners.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Third on our list is Tom Lee. Lee also ranks as one of the all-time greats when it comes to sports betting, and he has made a fortune thanks to his skills in this area. He is particularly renowned for his expertise in NFL betting, and he has often been able to turn a small stake into a huge return by predicting the outcomes of games accurately.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fourth on our list is Aaron Small. Small may not be as well known as some of the other names on this list, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a world-class player. In fact, Small is considered by many to be the best darts player of all time, and he has won countless tournaments thanks to his expert knowledge of the sport and his ability to place savvy bets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, we have Chris “Jesus” Ferguson. Ferguson may not have had as much success as some of the other players on this list, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t world-class when it comes to sports betting. In fact, Ferguson is widely seen as one of the most knowledgeable experts in this industry, and he has made a fortune by correctly predicting the outcomes of games over the years</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="The-5-worst-teams-in-500-sports-betting-history"><a href="#The-5-worst-teams-in-500-sports-betting-history" class="headerlink" title="The 5 worst teams in 500 sports betting history"></a>The 5 worst teams in 500 sports betting history</h1><p>Predicting the outcome of sporting events has been around for centuries, with different cultures taking different approaches to it. But no matter what form it takes, one thing is always certain - there are going to be bad teams. The 5 worst teams in 500 sports betting history may not be the obvious choices, but they have all made their mark on the industry.</p>
<p>Starting at the bottom, we have the 2005 Los Angeles Dodgers. This team was a mess from top to bottom, and it showed in their play on the field. They were one of the worst offensive teams in baseball that year, scoring just 670 runs while giving up 858. And things only got worse when they hit the betting lines, as they went 34-48 against the spread.</p>
<p>Next up is the 1990 Dallas Cowboys. This was a talented team that was expected to do big things,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> but they fell flat on their face right out of the gate. They finished 3-13 against the spread and 4-12 straight up, thanks in part to an offense that averaged just 15 points per game.</p>
<p>At number three we have the 2000 Baltimore Orioles. This squad was expected to be a contender in the AL East, but they ended up finishing dead last with a 35-47 record against the spread. Their pitching staff was especially bad, allowing 923 runs while posting a dismal 5.22 ERA.</p>
<p>Coming in at number two is another recent team - the 2016 Chicago Bears. With John Fox at the helm, this team was a disaster from start to finish. They went just 3-13 against the spread and 2-14 straight up, thanks in part to an offense that averaged just 14 points per game.</p>
<p>And finally, we have the undisputed champion of terrible sports bettors - the 1992 Philadelphia Eagles. This team finished 1-15 against the spread and posted an ugly 2-14 record straight up. Their defense allowed over 27 points per game while their offense could only manage 12 per contest - making them one of (if not THE) worst teams in NFL history when it comes to betting lines</p>
<h1 id="The-5-biggest-bets-in-500-sports-betting-history"><a href="#The-5-biggest-bets-in-500-sports-betting-history" class="headerlink" title="The 5 biggest bets in 500 sports betting history"></a>The 5 biggest bets in 500 sports betting history</h1><p>There have been some massive bets placed in the world of sports betting, with some punters risking huge sums of money in the hope of making a quick buck. In this article, we take a look at five of the biggest bets in history.</p>
<ol>
<li>£1 million on England to win the World Cup</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2014, an English punter placed a massive £1 million bet on his country to win the World Cup. Unfortunately for him, they were knocked out by Uruguay in the last 16.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>$19 million on Floyd Mayweather to beat Conor McGregor</li>
</ol>
<p>In what was one of the most talked-about fights in history, an American gambler placed a record $19 million bet on Floyd Mayweather to beat Conor McGregor. Mayweather duly won the fight and took home $100 million in prize money.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>£7.5 million on Roger Federer to win Wimbledon</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2009, a British gambler placed a huge £7.5 million bet on Roger Federer to win Wimbledon. The Swiss ace duly delivered and took home the title for the fifth time.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>$10 million on Barcelona to win Champions League</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2006, an American gambler placed a mammoth $10 million bet on Barcelona to win the Champions League final against Arsenal. The Spanish side duly won 2-1 and pocketed the biggest payout in betting history at that time.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>€11 million on Juventus to win Champions League</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2017, an Italian gambler put €11 million on Juventus to win the Champions League final against Real Madrid. The Bianconeri duly won 4-1 and scooped one of the biggest payouts in betting history.</p>
