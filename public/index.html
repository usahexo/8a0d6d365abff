        <h1 id="The-odds-of-winning-a-tie-in-sports-betting-are-just-13-percent"><a href="#The-odds-of-winning-a-tie-in-sports-betting-are-just-13-percent" class="headerlink" title="The odds of winning a tie in sports betting are just 13 percent!"></a>The odds of winning a tie in sports betting are just 13 percent!</h1><p>A tie in sports betting is a rare event that happens less than one time in every 10 games. The odds of winning when wagering on a tie are just 13 percent, making it one of the least favorable bets you can make.</p>
<p>There are a few things to take into account when betting on a tie. First, the outcome of the game must be even – if one team is heavily favored, the chance of them tying decreases significantly. In addition, certain sports offer better chances for a tie than others – in soccer matches, for example, the likelihood of a draw is considerably higher than in American football games.</p>
<p>Despite these factors, ties remain one of the least successful wagers you can make. If you’re looking to increase your chances of winning, there are much better options available. Instead of betting on a tie, focus on bets with more favorable odds – like predicting the winner or spread betting.</p>
<h1 id="100-on-a-tie-nets-you-just-13-in-winnings"><a href="#100-on-a-tie-nets-you-just-13-in-winnings" class="headerlink" title="$100 on a tie nets you just $13 in winnings!"></a>$100 on a tie nets you just $13 in winnings!</h1><p>Did you know that if you’re betting on a tie in professional football, you’re only looking at a potential return of 13%? That’s right - just $100 on a tie nets you only $13 in winnings!</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this, but the largest reason is simply because ties are so rare. In fact, they only happen about 2% of the time. So, if you’re betting on a tie, you’re basically risking everything for very little potential return.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s usually a better idea to look for other bets that offer more favorable odds. For example, betting on the underdog can often lead to much better returns than betting on a tie. In fact, in some cases you can get returns as high as 300% on an underdog bet!</p>
<p>So, if you’re looking to make some money off of your next football game, be sure to avoid betting on ties and instead look for more lucrative options.</p>
<h1 id="If-you’re-looking-for-a-higher-payout-consider-going-for-the-upset-instead"><a href="#If-you’re-looking-for-a-higher-payout-consider-going-for-the-upset-instead" class="headerlink" title="If you’re looking for a higher payout, consider going for the upset instead!"></a>If you’re looking for a higher payout, consider going for the upset instead!</h1><p>Betting on the underdog might not always pay out as much as betting on the favorite, but when it does, it can be a lot more profitable. In fact, if you’re looking to make some serious money from your bets, you may want to consider focusing on the underdogs more often than not.</p>
<p>Just how lucrative can betting on underdogs be? Well, consider this: over the past five years, underdogs have won 58% of all outright games. That means that if you bet on every underdog in every game over that time period, you would have made a profit. Granted, there have been some ups and downs throughout that time frame, but overall, underdogs have been a solid bet.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that betting on favorites is a bad idea – far from it. Favorites do win more games than underdogs do, after all. However, the payoff for betting on favorites tends to be lower than for betting on underdogs. In other words, if you’re looking for a big payout, going with the underdog is often your best option.</p>
<p>Of course, as with any type of gambling, there is always risk involved when betting on sports. However, by keeping an eye out for teams that are being underestimated by the public and by doing your homework on matchups and team histories, you can give yourself a better chance of winning when betting on underdogs.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-who-choose-to-play-it-safe-and-go-with-the-tie-often-come-up-short-changed"><a href="#Bettors-who-choose-to-play-it-safe-and-go-with-the-tie-often-come-up-short-changed" class="headerlink" title="Bettors who choose to play it safe and go with the tie often come up short-changed!"></a>Bettors who choose to play it safe and go with the tie often come up short-changed!</h1><p>Typically, in any given matchup between two evenly matched opponents, the odds of a draw are around 33 percent. This means that if you bet on a tie, there is about a one-in-three chance you will win your bet. So, for those of you who like to play it safe and choose not to risk your hard-earned cash on anything else but a draw, you are likely going to come up short-changed more often than not.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to bet on sports, and while betting on a draw may seem like the “safe” option, it is actually not the smartest way to go. For one thing, the odds of winning a bet on a draw are pretty low, so you are not likely to make much money by choosing this option. Additionally, when you bet on a draw, you are essentially betting against both teams and don’t have a clear rooting interest in the game. This can make watching the game less enjoyable and also lead to some tense moments if the game is close near the end.</p>
<p>So what should you do instead of betting on a draw? Well, one alternative is to bet on the underdog. The odds of an underdog winning are generally much higher than the odds of a team drawing or winning outright. So by betting on an underdog, you stand to make more money if they pull off an upset victory. Additionally, rooting for an underdog can be more fun than rooting for a heavily favored team that is likely to win anyway.</p>
<p>Another option is to bet on the over/under total number of points scored in the game. This type of bet allows you to predict whether there will be more or fewer points scored than what is set as the line by oddsmakers. By picking correctly, you can earn some nice profits.</p>
<p>In short, there are many better options than betting on a draw when placing wagers on sporting events. So if you’re looking to increase your chances of winning and have some good fun while doing so, try using some of the alternatives listed above instead!</p>
<h1 id="If-you-want-to-make-money-on-sports-betting-don’t-bet-on-a-tie"><a href="#If-you-want-to-make-money-on-sports-betting-don’t-bet-on-a-tie" class="headerlink" title="If you want to make money on sports betting, don’t bet on a tie!"></a>If you want to make money on sports betting, don’t bet on a tie!</h1><p>In any form of gambling, there is always a house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the house keeps regardless of the outcome. For most bets, this ranges from 2% to 5%. However, there are a select few bets where the house edge is much higher. These are generally bets that involve a tie as one of the possible outcomes.</p>
<p>One such bet is head-to-head betting in sports. When two teams play against each other, the odds of a tie are relatively high. This is because even if one team is significantly better than the other, it’s not always a sure thing that they will win. In fact, in many cases the underdog can pull off an upset. As such, bookmakers often offer very high odds on a tie.</p>
<p>This means that if you bet on a tie, you are essentially giving the house an automatic edge of about 10%. This makes it one of the worst bets you can make in any form of gambling. So if you’re looking to make some money on sports betting, avoid betting on ties at all costs!</p>

<p>Next, choose a room that has a low number of players. This will give you a better chance of winning since there will be fewer balls drawn. In addition, make sure the jackpot for the room is high enough that it is worth your time to play.</p>
<p>Once you have found a room that meets both of these criteria, it’s time to start playing! To increase your chances of winning, be sure to purchase as many cards as possible. The more cards you have in play, the greater your odds of winning will be.</p>
<p>Now that you have your cards in hand, it’s time to start marking them off as they are called. As soon as you see one of your numbers called, mark it off on your card(s). If you manage to mark off all of the numbers on one card before anyone else does, then you automatically win the jackpot!</p>
<p>Even if someone else manages to fill their card before you do, don’t worry – there are still other ways to win money on Bingo Clash Liberia. For example, many casinos offer smaller consolation prizes for players who manage to complete certain patterns on their cards.

<p>– speedsters: these balls move twice as fast as regular numbers, making it easier to get them into your grid quickly.</p>
<p>– blockers: these balls will block any other ball from entering your grid, making them very useful for preventing your opponents from winning.</p>
<p>– wilds: these balls can be used as any number you want, making it easier to complete your grid.</p>
<p>– jokers: these balls are worth two points instead of one, giving you an edge over your opponents.</p>

<li>Use power-ups wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Power-ups can be very helpful in Bingo Clash Liberia, but they should be used wisely. You only have a limited number of each type of power-up, so use them when they’ll be most effective. For example, use the bomb power-up when there are only a few numbers left in your grid – this will clear out all of your opponents’ squares and give you an easy win. Other good times to use power-ups include when you need an extra life or when you want to gain some extra points quickly.</p>

<p>Never hold four cards to a royal flush - always discard one and hope for the best. The odds of getting a royal flush are slim enough as it is; don’t decrease your chances by holding onto four cards.</p>
<p>If you’re dealt two pairs, always keep the pair that has the highest value. For example, if you’re dealt two kings and two sixes, keep the kings. If two pairs are of equal value, keep the first pair that was dealt to you.</p>
<p>And lastly, always remember that practice makes perfect! The more you play, the better your odds of winning will be.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Crush-the-Casino-at-Video-Poker-Learn-the-winning-techniques"><a href="#How-to-Crush-the-Casino-at-Video-Poker-Learn-the-winning-techniques" class="headerlink" title="How to Crush the Casino at Video Poker: Learn the winning techniques"></a>How to Crush the Casino at Video Poker: Learn the winning techniques</h1><p>Casinos and video poker machines seem to be everywhere. So, it is natural that you may be tempted to try your luck. After all, what’s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>But if you want to increase your chances of winning and come out a winner, there are a few things you need to know. Here are four tips on how to crush the casino at video poker:</p>
<p>Tip 1: Play Deuces Wild</p>
<p>Deuces Wild is one of the most popular video poker variants. In this game, all deuces (two symbols) are wild, which means they can act as any other card to help form a winning hand.</p>
<p>This provides players with lots of opportunities to win big payouts, so it’s a great game to play if you want to increase your chances of winning. Plus, Deuces Wild games usually have a higher payout percentage than other video poker variants, so you stand to win more money if you play this game.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Keep track of the payouts</p>
<p>When playing any casino game, it’s important to know the odds and understand the payout schedule. This is especially true when playing video poker, as the payouts can vary significantly from one variant to another.</p>
<p>For example, in Jacks or Better video poker, the payout for a royal flush is 250 coins. But in Joker Poker – a variant with a different payout schedule – the payout for a royal flush is 800 coins. So make sure you know what the payouts are for each variant before you start playing.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Use optimal strategy</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at video poker is by using optimal strategy. This involves making the best possible decisions based on the cards you are dealt and the payout schedule. You can find detailed optimal strategy charts online that will show you exactly what moves to make in any situation.</p>
<p>Tip 4: Bet max when possible</p>
<p>In most video poker variants, players are allowed to bet up to five coins per hand. And while betting five coins won’t always give you the best odds, it can definitely increase your chances of winning big payouts. So if you have a chance to bet max, take it!</p>

        <h1 id="Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Block-Out-Lights"><a href="#Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Block-Out-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Block Out Lights"></a>Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Block Out Lights</h1><p>In casinos, poker players may be found wearing sunglasses to block out the light. This is because they want to be able to see the cards better. The glare from the lights can make it difficult to see what is in front of them and this can lead to mistakes. When playing poker, it is important to be able to see the cards clearly in order to make good decisions.</p>
<p>Sunglasses are not just for blocking out light in casinos, though. They can also help protect your eyes from the sun’s UV rays. This is especially important if you are going to be spending a lot of time outdoors. Sunglasses can also help improve your vision by reducing eye fatigue.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a new pair of sunglasses, there are a few things that you should consider. The first thing is that you should choose a pair that blocks out as much UV radiation as possible. You should also make sure that the sunglasses provide good coverage and fit well on your face. Lastly, you should choose a style that you like and that fits your personality.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing sunglasses for playing poker, it is important to find a style that allows you to see the cards clearly. This means choosing a style that does not have too much glare or reflection. You may want to consider polarized sunglasses, which help reduce glare and improve vision.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Reduce-Glare"><a href="#Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Reduce-Glare" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Reduce Glare"></a>Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Reduce Glare</h1><p>Most poker players wear sunglasses to reduce glare and avoid being blinded by the light. While playing in a casino or at home, the bright light coming from the television or other light sources can be a major distraction and impact your play.</p>
<p>By wearing sunglasses, you can reduce the amount of glare that enters your eyes and improve your ability to see the cards more clearly. This is especially important in low-light situations where glare can be more noticeable.</p>
<p>Sunglasses aren’t just for reducing glare, though. They can also help improve your vision in general and make it easier for you to see objects in the distance. This is why many law enforcement officers and athletes use sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun and improve their performance.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to reduce glare and improve your vision while playing poker, then consider investing in a good pair of sunglasses. Not only will they make it easier for you to see the cards, but they will also help protect your eyes from the sun’s harmful UV rays.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Keep-Their-Eyes-in-Shade"><a href="#Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Keep-Their-Eyes-in-Shade" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Keep Their Eyes in Shade"></a>Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Keep Their Eyes in Shade</h1><p>Poker players, especially those who are playing in tournaments, often wear sunglasses. The sunglasses are not to look cool or to protect their eyes from the sun, but to keep their eyes in shade.</p>
<p>When you are playing poker, it is important to be able to see all of your opponents’ cards. If you are playing in a brightly lit room, your opponents’ cards will be difficult to see. This is because the light will be shining on their cards and making them difficult to see.</p>
<p>By wearing sunglasses, you can keep the light out of your eyes and make it easier to see your opponents’ cards. This is especially helpful when you are playing against someone who is sitting across from you at the table.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Help-Them-Concentrate"><a href="#Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-to-Help-Them-Concentrate" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Help Them Concentrate"></a>Poker Players Wear Sunglasses to Help Them Concentrate</h1><p>They may look like they are just trying to look cool, but sunglasses have become an essential part of many poker players’ arsenals. Poker players wear sunglasses not only to protect their eyes from the bright lights in casinos, but also to help them concentrate.</p>
<p>Sunglasses help shield poker players from the bright lights in casinos, which can sometimes be overwhelming. The glare from the lights can make it difficult for players to see their opponents’ cards, and it can also make it difficult for them to focus on their own cards. By wearing sunglasses, poker players can eliminate this distraction and focus on playing the game.</p>
<p>In addition to blocking out the light, sunglasses also help poker players avoid getting recognized. When playing in a casino, it is important for players to remain anonymous so that they can’t be easily targeted by other players. By wearing sunglasses, poker players can conceal their identity and avoid being targeted by other players.</p>
<p>Finally, sunglasses also help poker players focus on the game. In addition to blocking out the light and preventing recognition, sunglasses also help reduce distractions. When you’re wearing sunglasses, you’re less likely to be distracted by your surroundings and you can focus on playing the game.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-So-They-Can-See-the-Cards-Better"><a href="#Poker-Players-Wear-Sunglasses-So-They-Can-See-the-Cards-Better" class="headerlink" title="Poker Players Wear Sunglasses So They Can See the Cards Better"></a>Poker Players Wear Sunglasses So They Can See the Cards Better</h1><p>In the bright lights of a casino, or on a televised poker tournament, you may have noticed that many of the players are wearing sunglasses. It’s not to look cool - they’re actually doing it to help them see the cards better.</p>
<p>When you’re playing poker in a casino, the lights are set up to make it as difficult as possible for you to see your opponents’ cards. This is done intentionally so that the house can have an edge in the game. But by wearing sunglasses, poker players can reduce the glare and improve their vision.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a theory - there’s science behind it. A study by the University of Nevada found that when poker players wear sunglasses, they perform better than when they don’t wear them. The study showed that when playing in a brightly lit room, players who wore sunglasses made more correct decisions and won more money than those who didn’t wear sunglasses.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons for this. First, sunglasses reduce glare, making it easier for players to see their opponents’ cards. Second, sunglasses protect players’ eyes from UV radiation and from the bright lights in a casino. This is important, because exposure to UV radiation can cause eye problems such as cataracts and macular degeneration.</p>
<p>So if you’re ever playing poker in a casino, be sure to wear your shades!</p>

        <h1 id="New-Jersey-Becomes-the-Next-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#New-Jersey-Becomes-the-Next-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Becomes the Next State to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>New Jersey Becomes the Next State to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>After months of back-and-forth and a failed attempt at passing the bill in the state Assembly, New Jersey’s Senate finally legalized sports betting on Monday, May 14th. This comes just a week after the US Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports betting, opening up the market to all states.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law on Thursday, which would make New Jersey the second state after Delaware to offer legal sports betting. Murphy has already announced that he plans to place his first bet at Monmouth Park racetrack.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a major victory for Atlantic City casinos, which have been struggling to compete with gambling destinations in other states. It’s also good news for horse racing tracks, which will be able to offer more types of wagers and create new jobs.</p>
<p>But not everyone is happy about the decision. The National Football League (NFL) and other professional sports leagues argue that legalized sports betting could lead to game-fixing and other forms of cheating. They say that it would be better if the federal government crafted a uniform set of rules governing sports betting across all states.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no indication that Congress plans to take up this issue anytime soon. In the meantime, New Jersey is moving ahead with its plans to legalize sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Brooklyn-Nets-Could-Benefit-From-New-Jersey’s-New-Legislation"><a href="#Brooklyn-Nets-Could-Benefit-From-New-Jersey’s-New-Legislation" class="headerlink" title="Brooklyn Nets Could Benefit From New Jersey’s New Legislation"></a>Brooklyn Nets Could Benefit From New Jersey’s New Legislation</h1><p>The Brooklyn Nets, a professional basketball team in the NBA, were founded in 1967 as part of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The team was originally located in Teaneck, New Jersey and was known as the New Jersey Americans. In 1974, the team moved to Brooklyn and was renamed the Brooklyn Nets.</p>
<p>The Nets have had a tough go of it in recent years. They have failed to make the NBA playoffs for six consecutive seasons and have had one winning season during that time period. In an effort to revive the franchise, the Nets organization made some major changes prior to the start of the 2017-2018 season. They hired a new head coach, Jeremy Lin, and a new general manager, Sean Marks.</p>
<p>The Nets also made some changes to their roster. They acquired D’Angelo Russell from the Los Angeles Lakers and DeMarre Carroll from the Toronto Raptors. The team also signed free agents Jahlil Okafor and Kenneth Faried.</p>
<p>Despite these moves, the Nets struggled at the beginning of the season. They had a record of 10-27 as of January 1, 2018. One of the reasons for their poor performance was their lack of talent compared to other teams in the NBA.</p>
<p>In an attempt to improve their roster, the Nets have recently been linked with several potential trade targets. These players include Kyrie Irving of the Boston Celtics, Jimmy Butler of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>However, these trades may be difficult to complete due to salary cap constraints. The Nets only have $5 million in available cap space for next season, which is not enough to sign any of these players outright.</p>
<p>This is where New Jersey’s new legislation could help out the Nets. Under this new legislation, New Jersey will allow teams who relocate within its borders to keep their original payroll exemption amount. This means that if the Nets were to move to New Jersey, they would be able to keep their $5 million exemption amount for next season. This would give them more flexibility when making trades with other teams.</p>
<p>There has been speculation that the Nets could move to Newark, New Jersey if they are unable to land a superstar player via trade. Newark is only about 15 miles away from Brooklyn and has an arena that could accommodate an NBA team (the Prudential Center).</p>
<p>If Newark is indeed where the Nets end up moving, it could benefit both cities economically. Newark could see an influx of fans coming into town for game nights and business owners could see an increase in revenue from increased tourism activity. Brooklyn could also benefit from this move as it would now be home to two professional basketball teams (the Brooklyn Nets and NYC FC).</p>
<h1 id="How-Sports-Betting-Will-Impact-the-Brooklyn-Nets"><a href="#How-Sports-Betting-Will-Impact-the-Brooklyn-Nets" class="headerlink" title="How Sports Betting Will Impact the Brooklyn Nets"></a>How Sports Betting Will Impact the Brooklyn Nets</h1><p>The Brooklyn Nets were one of the surprise teams of the NBA last season, making the playoffs when most people didn’t expect them to. But there are big changes in store for the Nets this season – most notably, their move from New Jersey to Brooklyn.</p>
<p>One other big change for the Nets this season is their new arena – the Barclays Center. This brand new arena is sure to be a huge draw for fans, and it will also be a major factor in how sports betting will impact the Brooklyn Nets.</p>
<p>The Barclays Center has a seating capacity of 18,000, which is more than any other arena in New York City. This means that the Barclays Center will be able to attract some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. It will also be a major destination for sports fans, as it will be home to both the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Islanders.</p>
<p>So how will sports betting impact the Brooklyn Nets? There are two primary ways: first, by increasing fan interest in the team, and second, by providing a financial incentive for team owners.</p>
<p>Fan interest in the Nets is sure to increase with their move to Brooklyn. And with a new arena like the Barclays Center, fans will now have an even greater incentive to bet on games. This is especially true for games at home – with a hometown crowd behind them, the Nets are sure to be even more competitive this season.</p>
<p>The Barclays Center is also expected to have a major impact on team ownership. The new arena provides an important financial incentive for team owners, as they will now receive a percentage of all food and beverage sales from within the arena. This could lead to increased competition among teams to make it into the playoffs, as team owners will have an added incentive to invest in their teams and make them successful.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-the-Future-of-Sports-Betting"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-the-Future-of-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for the Future of Sports Betting?"></a>What Does This Mean for the Future of Sports Betting?</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal law that effectively banned state-sponsored sports betting. The 6-3 ruling opens up the door for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their own borders.</p>
<p>The decision generated a great deal of excitement in the gambling industry, with many predicting that it will lead to a surge in sports betting activity. It also sparked concerns among some who worry that legalizing sports betting could lead to an increase in gambling addiction and other negative consequences.</p>
<p>So what does this ruling mean for the future of sports betting? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h1 id="The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalizing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Legalizing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="The Pros and Cons of Legalizing Sports Betting"></a>The Pros and Cons of Legalizing Sports Betting</h1><p>Supporters of legalizing sports betting argue that it would provide a much-needed revenue boost to cash-strapped states, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry. They also argue that it would help to deter crime by moving illegal gambling operations out into the open.</p>
<p>Critics of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates, as well as contribute to other social ills such as corruption and organized crime. They also worry that children and teens will be especially vulnerable to the dangers of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="The-Reality-of-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#The-Reality-of-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="The Reality of Legalized Sports Betting"></a>The Reality of Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>So far, only a few states have taken steps to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court’s ruling. Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and West Virginia have all passed legislation authorizing some form of state-sponsored sports betting. Other states are expected to follow suit in the coming years.</p>
<p>How exactly legalized sports betting will play out remains to be seen. It’s likely that different states will adopt different approaches, with some opting for full-scale casinos with robust sportsbooks while others may limit it to online or mobile platforms. In any case, it’s clear that we’re entering a new era for legalized sports betting in America.</p>
<h1 id="States-Taking-Action-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#States-Taking-Action-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="States Taking Action to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>States Taking Action to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court overturned a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. The 6-3 ruling in favor of New Jersey opens the door for other states to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Court’s decision, Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia have all passed bills to legalize sports betting. Illinois is considering a bill to legalize sports betting, and several other states are also exploring the possibility of legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to state governments. They also argue that it would create jobs and stimulate the economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems and crime. They also argue that it would be unfair to people who do not gamble.</p>
<p>So far, there is no consensus among states on whether to legalize sports betting. Some states are moving quickly to legalize it, while others are taking a more cautious approach. It remains to be seen how many states will ultimately legalize sports betting.</p>

        <h1 id="SSC-Napoli-Continues-to-Grow-in-the-Sports-Betting-Marketplace"><a href="#SSC-Napoli-Continues-to-Grow-in-the-Sports-Betting-Marketplace" class="headerlink" title="SSC Napoli Continues to Grow in the Sports Betting Marketplace"></a>SSC Napoli Continues to Grow in the Sports Betting Marketplace</h1><p>The Serie A football club, SSC Napoli, is continuing its aggressive growth in the sports betting marketplace. The Naples-based football club has seen a surge in its online betting popularity, in particular with its Asian fanbase.</p>
<p>In an effort to better serve its global audience, the club has teamed up with Singapore-based gaming company OCBC Bank as its Official Betting Partner. The partnership will see OCBC become the exclusive banking partner of SSC Napoli for all of its customers based in Asia.</p>
<p>This move comes on the heels of SSC Napoli’s recent launch of its new international website, which is now available in English, Chinese and Japanese. The website is designed to provide fans with all the latest information on the club, including news, fixtures and results, as well as exclusive player and management interviews.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have OCBC Bank on board as our Official Betting Partner as we continue our aggressive growth into the Asian market,” said Andrea Chiavelli, co-founder of marketing company 919 Advertising, who worked on developing SSC Napoli’s new international website.</p>
<p>OCBC Bank’s CEO Samuel Tsien was equally enthusiastic about the new partnership. “As one of Asia’s most established banks with a strong focus on customer centricity, we are excited to work with SSC Napoli and leverage our strengths in technology and innovation to bring an exceptional betting experience to their fans in Asia.”</p>
<p>For SSC Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis, this new partnership is another important step in cementing the club’s place as one of Europe’s top football clubs. “Our goal is to become one of the top clubs not just in Italy but also in Europe. This partnership with OCBC Bank is another important milestone on that journey and we look forward to working closely with them to grow our brand across Asia.”</p>
<h1 id="SSC-Napoli-is-Among-the-Largest-Soccer-Clubs-in-the-Sports-Betting-World"><a href="#SSC-Napoli-is-Among-the-Largest-Soccer-Clubs-in-the-Sports-Betting-World" class="headerlink" title="SSC Napoli is Among the Largest Soccer Clubs in the Sports Betting World"></a>SSC Napoli is Among the Largest Soccer Clubs in the Sports Betting World</h1><p>The Serie A club is ranked as one of the biggest and most successful football clubs in the sports betting world. The Neapolitan outfit has a rich history that goes back to 1926, and it has been crowned champions of Italy on multiple occasions. Napoli is also one of the most popular clubs in Europe, with a large and passionate fanbase that follows the team all over the world.</p>
<h1 id="The-Club’s-Early-Successes"><a href="#The-Club’s-Early-Successes" class="headerlink" title="The Club’s Early Successes"></a>The Club’s Early Successes</h1><p>The early years of Napoli’s history were characterised by continuous success on the pitch. After being founded in 1926, they reached the semi-finals of the Italian Cup in their first season, narrowly losing out to eventual winners Alessandria. They made their debut in Serie A in 1929 and enjoyed a successful first season, finishing fourth in the table. The following year they reached the final of the Coppa Italia, but were beaten by Roma.</p>
<p>In 1936 Napoli finally won their first major trophy, beating Bologna to lift the Coppa Italia. They also finished second in Serie A that season, just two points behind champions Juventus. The club continued to enjoy success in the 1940s, winning two league titles and two Coppa Italias. However, they were unable to replicate this success after the Second World War and eventually dropped down to Serie B in 1953.</p>
<h1 id="Re-Emergence-Under-Corrado-Ferlaino"><a href="#Re-Emergence-Under-Corrado-Ferlaino" class="headerlink" title="Re-Emergence Under Corrado Ferlaino"></a>Re-Emergence Under Corrado Ferlaino</h1><p>Napoli were promoted back to Serie A at the first attempt under new president Corrado Ferlaino. He invested heavily in the squad and appointed Enrico Eco as manager, and this proved to be a shrewd move as Napoli won their first ever Scudetto in 1986/87. They also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup that season, losing out to eventual winners PSV Eindhoven. Ferlaino then stepped down as president but remained involved with Napoli as a business man until his death in 1994.</p>
<h1 id="Recent-Successes"><a href="#Recent-Successes" class="headerlink" title="Recent Successes"></a>Recent Successes</h1><p>Napoli have continued to enjoy success in recent years, reaching Champions League qualifications on a number of occasions. They won their second league title in 1989/90 but then endured a barren period which saw them finish no higher than sixth place between 1992 and 2003. However, they regained some momentum towards the end of that decade, reaching two Champions League semi-finals (in 2005/06 and 2006/07) and winning their third league title in 2007/08.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Fuels-SSC-Napoli-Economic-Engine"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Fuels-SSC-Napoli-Economic-Engine" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Fuels SSC Napoli Economic Engine"></a>Sports Betting Fuels SSC Napoli Economic Engine</h1><p>This season, SSC Napoli are having their best ever Serie A campaign. Manager Maurizio Sarri has them playing some of the most attractive football in Europe and they find themselves in second place in the table, behind Juventus only on goal difference. Napoli’s success is down to many factors, but one key one is the team’s ability to attract money from sports betting.</p>
<p>According to a study by the Italian gaming company Intralot, in the 2016/17 season Napoli raked in €57.8 million from sports betting—more than any other club in Serie A. This amounted to over 14% of the club’s total revenue for that season. The next highest earners were Juventus (€53.6 million), Roma (€36.5 million) and Milan (€33.9 million).</p>
<p>Why are Napoli such a popular team to bet on? Partly it’s because they have a large and passionate fan base, but it’s also down to their attacking style of play and the fact that they are usually competitive for major trophies. In addition, many neutrals like to back them against big teams like Juve or Milan, as they see them as underdogs with David-versus-Goliath potential.</p>
<p>The money generated by sports betting is important for Napoli as it helps finance their transfer activities and keeps them competitive with Europe’s top clubs. Last summer they spent over €150 million on new players, including top stars like Jorginho and Lorenzo Insigne. Without the extra revenue from betting, it’s likely they wouldn’t have been able to afford such high-profile signings.</p>
<p>Napoli will be looking to continue their good form in this year’s Champions League campaign; they currently sit second in their group behind Manchester City with two wins and one draw from their first three games. If they can make it through to the knockout stages it will be another payday for the club from sports betting enthusiasts around the world.</p>

<p>The club’s iconic blue colours are recognised all over the world, and their matches are some of the most watched events in Italy.
