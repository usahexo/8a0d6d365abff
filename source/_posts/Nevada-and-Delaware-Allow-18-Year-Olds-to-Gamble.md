#  Nevada and Delaware Allow 18-Year-Olds to Gamble

The states of Nevada and Delaware have now both lowered the gambling age to 18, in a move that is hoped to stimulate tourism and tax revenue. This comes as a change from the norm, as the federal minimum gambling age is 21.

Both states have issued statements saying that they conducted extensive research into the matter before coming to this decision. In particular, they looked at how other countries handle the matter and found that the most successful ones allow 18-year-olds to gamble.

Delaware’s Finance Secretary, Tom Cook, said: "I'm convinced that this is the right thing for Delaware. There's a lot of research out there that suggests people who start gambling at an earlier age are more likely to continue gambling through their lives."

Nevada’s Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett added: "We looked everywhere at what was being done throughout the world and we think this makes sense for our state."

There has been some criticism levelled at the decisions, with some saying that it will lead to more addiction problems further down the line. But supporters of the measure say that it will help keep gambling out of the hands of criminals, as well as generating much-needed revenue for both states.

#  Missouri Allows 18-Year-Olds to Bet on Horse Racing

The state of Missouri has recently voted to allow 18-year-olds to gamble on horse racing. This new law is expected to bring in more than $5 million in tax revenue for the state, as well as create hundreds of new jobs.

Critics of the new measure say that it will lead to increased addiction and crime rates, but supporters argue that the benefits outweigh the risks. They point out that adults are already able to gamble in casinos and at race tracks, so it only makes sense to extend this privilege to younger adults as well.

Those who are in favor of the change also argue that it will help keep Missouri’s horse racing industry alive and thriving. Without this new influx of revenue, they say, many racetracks may have to close their doors.

So far, there hasn’t been any decisive research on the effects of allowing 18-year-olds to gamble on horse racing. However, if past studies are any indication, it’s likely that there will be both positive and negative consequences.

On the one hand, young people may be more likely to develop gambling addictions at a younger age. On the other hand, they may also be more likely to learn responsible gambling habits from an early age.

It will be interesting to see how this policy plays out in Missouri – and whether any other states decide to follow suit.

#  Oregon Allows 18-Year-Olds to Place Wagers on Sports

Oregon has decided to allow 18-year-olds to place bets on sports, becoming the latest state to legalize sports betting. Oregon officials say that the change will help to generate revenue for the state, and that the new law will also help to protect consumers. The decision comes as many other states are also moving to legalize sports betting, in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the activity.

Oregon is one of several states that has moved to legalize sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling last year that struck down a federal ban on the activity. In that case, Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal prohibition on sports betting was unconstitutional. The ruling paved the way for states to decide whether or not to legalize sports betting within their borders.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, with Oregon being among the most recent. Officials in Oregon say that the new law will help to generate revenue for the state, as well as protect consumers. The change will allow 18-year-olds in Oregon to place bets on sporting events, joining those who are 21 and older.

Legalizing sports betting has been seen as a way for states to tap into what is expected to be a lucrative market. In a report released earlier this year, analysts at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming estimated that legalized sports betting could generate as much as $6 billion in annual revenue nationwide. That number is expected to grow over time, as more people become familiar with legalized sports betting and more states move to legalize it.

For states like Oregon, which are facing budget shortfalls, legalizing sports betting represents a potential source of new revenue. In addition, officials in those states say that regulating and taxing sports betting can help protect consumers from fraud or other harm.

While some lawmakers have expressed concerns about gambling addiction or other negative effects of legalized sports betting, most state officials seem eager to tap into what is seen as a promising new market. So far, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey and West Virginia have all moved to legalize some form of sports gambling since the Supreme Court’s ruling last year.

#  Washington State Allows Gambling at 18 Years Old

Washington State recently voted to change the gambling age from 21 to 18 years old. This could have a significant impact on the state’s gambling industry, as young adults will now be able to participate in many types of gambling activities.

The change was approved by a vote of 57-41, with most Republicans voting against the measure and most Democrats voting in favor of it. According to Republican state senator Phil Fortunato, this is a “slippery slope” that could lead to more widespread gambling addiction.

Democratic state senator Natasha Kwan, however, believes that the change will help protect young adults from addiction while also providing them with more opportunities to gamble responsibly. She stated: “There are certainly people who are going to be irresponsible whether they are 18 or 21, but I think giving people more choice and freedom at an earlier age is actually a good thing.”

It remains to be seen how this change will impact Washington State’s gambling industry, but it is likely that we will see more young adults participating in casino games, sports betting, and other types of gambling.

#  North Dakota Legalized Gambling at 18 in October 2017

North Dakota residents who are at least 18 years old can now legally gamble in the state. The Legal Age to Gamble in North Dakota Amendment, which was approved by voters on October 24, 2017, lowers the legal gambling age from 21 to 18.

According to the North Dakota Gambling Control Board, the amendment will allow people aged 18 and older to play bingo, participate in raffles, play pull tabs, and gamble at the state's four casinos. It will also allow those aged 18 and older to work as gaming employees at casinos.

The amendment was supported by a number of groups, including the North Dakota Retail Association and the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce. In a statement issued ahead of the vote, Tim webcam girls Schellberg, president and CEO of the North Dakota Chamber of Commerce, said that the amendment would "help create jobs and economic opportunity in our state."

Opponents of the amendment argued that it would lead to more gambling addiction and problems for young people. But proponents argued that adults are capable of making their own decisions about gambling and that lowering the legal age would help bring more tourism dollars into the state.

North Dakota is not alone in lowering its legal gambling age. A number of other states have also lowered their legal gambling ages in recent years. In 2013, Arkansas lowered its legal gambling age from 21 to 18. And in 2015, both Iowa and Indiana reduced their legal gambling ages from 21 to 19.
