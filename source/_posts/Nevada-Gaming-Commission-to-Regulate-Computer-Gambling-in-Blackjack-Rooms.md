#  Nevada Gaming Commission to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms

The Nevada Gaming Commission has announced that it would start regulating computer gambling in blackjack rooms. The commission is specifically targeting the use of bots, which are computer programs that play blackjack and other casino games.

Regulating computer gambling could prove to be a challenge for the commission. For one, bots can be programmed to behave in ways that are difficult to detect. They can also make split-second decisions that human players cannot. As a result, it may be difficult for casino staff to determine whether a particular player is using a bot or not.

In addition, there is no foolproof way to prevent people from using bots. Some people may simply choose to ignore the regulations and find ways to use bots anyway.

There are also concerns that regulating computer gambling could negatively impact the gaming industry. If bots are able to consistently win money against human players, people may start avoiding blackjack and other casino games altogether. This could lead to fewer people playing these games, and ultimately less revenue for casinos.

#  Blackjack Computer Regulation Signed by Nevada Governor

Governor Brian Sandoval has signed a bill into law regulating the playing of blackjack by computers. The new law, SB 228, allows casinos in Nevada to use computer programs to play the game, as long as certain conditions are met.

One of the main purposes of the new law is to ensure that casino patrons have a fair chance against the computer. To that end, the law prohibits casinos from using programs that are overly advantageous to the house. In addition, casinos must make the computer playing program available to players for inspection.

The new law takes effect on October 1, 2017.

#  Blackjack Computer Regulations a Win for Casinos and Gamblers Alike

The regulation of blackjack computer use by casinos in the United States may seem like a negative for gamblers, but it is really a win-win situation for both the casinos and the players.

Players who use computers to help them beat the casino will no longer be able to do so as the new regulations prohibit their use. Casinos, on the other hand, can now be confident that their games are fair and that players are not using any outside help to beat them. This protects their profits and ensures that players are not taking unfair advantage of the casino.

Aside from being fair to both casinos and players, these regulations are also good for the economy. They create jobs in the casino industry and help to keep money within our borders rather than going to foreign casinos.

So, while some may see these new regulations as a negative, I believe that they are actually a positive development for all involved.

#  Nevada Officials Gear Up to Regulate Computer Gambling in Blackjack Rooms

The Nevada Gaming Commission is considering a proposal that would allow regulated computer gambling in blackjack rooms. The proposed regulation would set rules for the use of computerized devices to play blackjack in live dealer gaming environments.

If approved, the regulation would require Nevada casino operators to install computerized blackjack tables in at least 10% of their live dealer gaming areas. The devices would only be allowed to be used by players who are seated at the table, and all games would be conducted under the watch of a human dealer.

In introducing the proposal, Commission chairman Tony Alamo said, "We believe that this type of game will provide a new level of excitement and entertainment for our customers, while also providing an additional option for our gaming operators."

Some industry observers are skeptical about the proposal, however. They argue that the added convenience of using a computer may not be enough to overcome the fact that players are still playing against other people at a physical table.

Others contend that allowing computer gambling could create security risks, as well as concerns about fairness and accuracy. There is also some concern that the introduction of such devices could cannibalize business from traditional blackjack tables.

#  Blackjack Computers to be Regulated by Gaming Licensing Boards

In the wake of the popular release of the blackjack computer, gaming licensing boards around the world have been racing to draft regulations for their use.

The devices, which typically consist of a small computer and concealed card-reading hardware, allow players to track the cards that have been dealt and make strategic decisions accordingly. This gives them a significant edge over other players, particularly in traditional casino settings where human dealers are used.

As a result, many gaming boards are now seeking to prohibit their use in casinos, or at least restrict their deployment to certain areas of the casino floor. In addition, they are also looking at ways to levy fines and penalties against people caught using blackjack computers.

“The use of blackjack computers fundamentally alters the playing field in casinos and gives an unfair advantage to those using them,” said one board spokesperson. “We need to take steps to ensure that our casinos remain fair and competitive places for all players.”

However, not everyone agrees with this approach. Some industry observers feel that the regulation of blackjack computers is unnecessary and will only serve to hamper innovation in the industry.

“These devices have been around for years and have never caused any real problems,” said one observer. “The fact is that they can be used by both skilled and unskilled players, so why should we single them out?”

Regardless of which side of the argument you fall on, it is clear that blackjack computers are here to stay – and that gaming licensing boards will be playing a key role in regulating their use from now on.
