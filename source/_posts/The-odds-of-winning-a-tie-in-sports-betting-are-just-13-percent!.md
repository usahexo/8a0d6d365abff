#  The odds of winning a tie in sports betting are just 13 percent!

A tie in sports betting is a rare event that happens less than one time in every 10 games. The odds of winning when wagering on a tie are just 13 percent, making it one of the least favorable bets you can make.

There are a few things to take into account when betting on a tie. First, the outcome of the game must be even – if one team is heavily favored, the chance of them tying decreases significantly. In addition, certain sports offer better chances for a tie than others – in soccer matches, for example, the likelihood of a draw is considerably higher than in American football games.

Despite these factors, ties remain one of the least successful wagers you can make. If you're looking to increase your chances of winning, there are much better options available. Instead of betting on a tie, focus on bets with more favorable odds – like predicting the winner or spread betting.

#  $100 on a tie nets you just $13 in winnings!

Did you know that if you're betting on a tie in professional football, you're only looking at a potential return of 13%? That's right - just $100 on a tie nets you only $13 in winnings!

There are a number of reasons for this, but the largest reason is simply because ties are so rare. In fact, they only happen about 2% of the time. So, if you're betting on a tie, you're basically risking everything for very little potential return.

Instead, it's usually a better idea to look for other bets that offer more favorable odds. For example, betting on the underdog can often lead to much better returns than betting on a tie. In fact, in some cases you can get returns as high as 300% on an underdog bet!

So, if you're looking to make some money off of your next football game, be sure to avoid betting on ties and instead look for more lucrative options.

#  If you're looking for a higher payout, consider going for the upset instead!

Betting on the underdog might not always pay out as much as betting on the favorite, but when it does, it can be a lot more profitable. In fact, if you're looking to make some serious money from your bets, you may want to consider focusing on the underdogs more often than not.

Just how lucrative can betting on underdogs be? Well, consider this: over the past five years, underdogs have won 58% of all outright games. That means that if you bet on every underdog in every game over that time period, you would have made a profit. Granted, there have been some ups and downs throughout that time frame, but overall, underdogs have been a solid bet.

This isn't to say that betting on favorites is a bad idea – far from it. Favorites do win more games than underdogs do, after all. However, the payoff for betting on favorites tends to be lower than for betting on underdogs. In other words, if you're looking for a big payout, going with the underdog is often your best option.

Of course, as with any type of gambling, there is always risk involved when betting on sports. However, by keeping an eye out for teams that are being underestimated by the public and by doing your homework on matchups and team histories, you can give yourself a better chance of winning when betting on underdogs.

#  Bettors who choose to play it safe and go with the tie often come up short-changed!

Typically, in any given matchup between two evenly matched opponents, the odds of a draw are around 33 percent. This means that if you bet on a tie, there is about a one-in-three chance you will win your bet. So, for those of you who like to play it safe and choose not to risk your hard-earned cash on anything else but a draw, you are likely going to come up short-changed more often than not.

There are many different ways to bet on sports, and while betting on a draw may seem like the "safe" option, it is actually not the smartest way to go. For one thing, the odds of winning a bet on a draw are pretty low, so you are not likely to make much money by choosing this option. Additionally, when you bet on a draw, you are essentially betting against both teams and don't have a clear rooting interest in the game. This can make watching the game less enjoyable and also lead to some tense moments if the game is close near the end.

So what should you do instead of betting on a draw? Well, one alternative is to bet on the underdog. The odds of an underdog winning are generally much higher than the odds of a team drawing or winning outright. So by betting on an underdog, you stand to make more money if they pull off an upset victory. Additionally, rooting for an underdog can be more fun than rooting for a heavily favored team that is likely to win anyway.

Another option is to bet on the over/under total number of points scored in the game. This type of bet allows you to predict whether there will be more or fewer points scored than what is set as the line by oddsmakers. By picking correctly, you can earn some nice profits.

In short, there are many better options than betting on a draw when placing wagers on sporting events. So if you're looking to increase your chances of winning and have some good fun while doing so, try using some of the alternatives listed above instead!

#  If you want to make money on sports betting, don't bet on a tie!

In any form of gambling, there is always a house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the house keeps regardless of the outcome. For most bets, this ranges from 2% to 5%. However, there are a select few bets where the house edge is much higher. These are generally bets that involve a tie as one of the possible outcomes.

One such bet is head-to-head betting in sports. When two teams play against each other, the odds of a tie are relatively high. This is because even if one team is significantly better than the other, it's not always a sure thing that they will win. In fact, in many cases the underdog can pull off an upset. As such, bookmakers often offer very high odds on a tie.

This means that if you bet on a tie, you are essentially giving the house an automatic edge of about 10%. This makes it one of the worst bets you can make in any form of gambling. So if you're looking to make some money on sports betting, avoid betting on ties at all costs!
