Cherokee Casino NC is among the most popular casinos in Western North Carolina. Situated minutes from downtown Cherokee, it is convenient for visitors to the Qualla Boundary and tourists taking a scenic drive on the Blue Ridge Parkway. The casino has both smoking and non-smoking areas, as well as nearly 900 slots and video poker games, 26 table games, and a high-limit area. There is also a food court and several restaurants located on site.

The casino was established in 1996 as part of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians’ effort to create jobs and economic opportunity for their people. The tribe owns and operates the casino, which is one of six Native American casinos in the state of North Carolina. In addition to the casino’s gaming offerings, it also has a hotel, fitness center, meeting space, and event venue.

One interesting fact about Cherokee Casino NC is that it’s located on land that once belonged to freed slaves. After the Civil War, these people were granted parcels of land by the federal government in what is now western North Carolina. The Chickamauga Cherokee Nation (part of the EBCI) purchased some of this land in 1884 and opened a coal mine on it. In 1996, the tribe decided to use some of this land to build a casino—a decision that has created jobs and economic opportunity for their people ever since.
