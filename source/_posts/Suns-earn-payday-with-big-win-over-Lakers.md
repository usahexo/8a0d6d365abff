#  Suns earn payday with big win over Lakers

PHOENIX -- Devin Booker scored 37 points, TJ Warren had 21 and the Phoenix Suns beat LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers 115-99 on Tuesday night for their first win of the season.

James had 28 points and nine assists for the Lakers in their first game since head coach Luke Walton was fired. They trailed by as many as 22 points and never led after the first quarter.

Phoenix scored the first eight points of the game and never looked back, using a 20-6 run to open a 34-19 lead after one quarter. The Suns led by 16 at halftime and 22 entering the fourth quarter.

Josh Hart added 18 points for the Lakers. Lonzo Ball had 10 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.

It was Phoenix's first win over Los Angeles since March 6, 2017. The Lakers had won six in a row overall in the series.

#  Bets on Suns to pay off against slumping Nuggets

Both the Phoenix Suns (11-25) and Denver Nuggets (15-21) have been struggling as of late, but the Suns are coming into Wednesday night's matchup with some recent momentum. The Nuggets, meanwhile, have lost six of their last 10 games.

Denver is favored by 3.5 points in this contest, according to OddsShark, with a betting total of 217.5. But the Suns have been better on the road than at home this season and could pull off the upset against a Nuggets team that is sans Gary Harris (hamstring) and Jamal Murray (ankle).

Phoenix won its last game 116-104 against the Sacramento Kings on Sunday, with Devin Booker scoring 38 points on 14-of-21 shooting. center Deandre Ayton had his best game as a pro in that contest, totaling 26 points and 18 rebounds.

The Nuggets are coming off a 119-100 loss to the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. Nikola Jokic led Denver with 23 points and 11 rebounds, while Will Barton added 22 points.

Harris and Murray are both out for this game, which gives rookie Michael Porter Jr. an opportunity to see more minutes off the bench. Porter was impressive in his NBA debut last week against the Minnesota Timberwolves, scoring 18 points in just 15 minutes.

Booker is averaging 26.2 points per game this season for Phoenix and should be able to take advantage of a porous Nuggets defense that is allowing 111.1 points per game (27th in the league). The Suns have also been effective from beyond the arc recently, hitting 38 percent of their 3-point attempts over their past five games.

Denver has struggled defensively all season long, so take advantage of the Suns being underdogs in this one and back them to pull off the upset.

#  Payouts imminent after big weekend for Phoenix Suns

The Phoenix Suns are coming off a big win against the Boston Celtics, and things are looking up for the team. The victory puts them in a good position as they head into the final stretch of the season, and fans are hopeful that this could be the year that they make it to the playoffs.

There has been plenty of speculation about how the Suns will distribute their payouts if they do make it to the postseason. Coach Igor Kokoskov has said that he is not concerned about money, but players like Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton are likely to be looking for a pay raise.

Regardless of how much money is at stake, the Suns are determined to make a good run in the playoffs. They have been playing better basketball as of late, and with Booker and Ayton leading the way, there is no telling what they might be able to achieve.

#  Got your money on the Suns? Here's when you'll get paid

The Phoenix Suns are one of the most exciting teams in the NBA this year. Led by Devin Booker and newcomers like Deandre Ayton, they're a team on the rise who could make a lot of noise in the playoffs.

If you've got your money on the Suns, when can you expect to see that money pay off?

According to sportsbettingdime.com, the Suns currently have odds of +4000 to win the NBA championship this year. If you put down $100 on them, you'd win $4000 if they pulled off the upset and won it all.

Of course, there's always the chance that they could fall short and not even make it out of the first round. But if you're feeling lucky, now might be a good time to bet on them.

Even if they don't manage to take home the championship, they should still be a good team to bet on for the regular season. Their odds for winning the Western Conference are currently at +1400, which means that a $100 bet would net you $1400 if they pull it off.

You can also bet on them to make it to the Finals. Their odds for doing so are currently at +3300, which would pay out $3300 on a $100 bet.

So whether you're betting on them to win it all or just making some smaller wagers, there's plenty of potential payoff available when it comes to betting on the Phoenix Suns this year.

#  Suns banking on another victory, payout to follow

On a hot streak and seeking their seventh consecutive win, the Phoenix Suns (10-7) will matchup against the Utah Jazz (6-11) at home tonight. The Suns are four-point favorites with a moneyline of -175.

The game could be a costly one for the Jazz, who will have to cover Gordon Hayward’s $15.8 million salary. Hayward is averaging 19.3 points and 5.7 rebounds this season and is coming off a 27-point performance against the Lakers on Sunday.

The Suns have been led by Devin Booker this season, who is averaging 24.2 points, 4.5 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game. Booker had 38 points in the Suns’ 117-110 victory over the Jazz on November 5th.

Phoenix has been one of the surprise teams in the NBA this season, thanks to their high-powered offense that is averaging 111.1 points per game (fifth in the NBA). They are also shooting 47 percent from the field as a team (seventh in the NBA) and 39 percent from three-point range (seventh in the NBA).

However, they will need to tighten up their defense, which ranks 22nd in the league in terms of efficiency, allowing 108 points per 100 possessions. Utah is averaging 103.9 points per game and features two 20-point scorers of their own in Rodney Hood and Hayward.
