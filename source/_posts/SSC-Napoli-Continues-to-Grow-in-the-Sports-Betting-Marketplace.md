# SSC Napoli Continues to Grow in the Sports Betting Marketplace

The Serie A football club, SSC Napoli, is continuing its aggressive growth in the sports betting marketplace. The Naples-based football club has seen a surge in its online betting popularity, in particular with its Asian fanbase.

In an effort to better serve its global audience, the club has teamed up with Singapore-based gaming company OCBC Bank as its Official Betting Partner. The partnership will see OCBC become the exclusive banking partner of SSC Napoli for all of its customers based in Asia.

This move comes on the heels of SSC Napoli’s recent launch of its new international website, which is now available in English, Chinese and Japanese. The website is designed to provide fans with all the latest information on the club, including news, fixtures and results, as well as exclusive player and management interviews.

“We are delighted to have OCBC Bank on board as our Official Betting Partner as we continue our aggressive growth into the Asian market,” said Andrea Chiavelli, co-founder of marketing company 919 Advertising, who worked on developing SSC Napoli’s new international website.

OCBC Bank’s CEO Samuel Tsien was equally enthusiastic about the new partnership. “As one of Asia’s most established banks with a strong focus on customer centricity, we are excited to work with SSC Napoli and leverage our strengths in technology and innovation to bring an exceptional betting experience to their fans in Asia.”

For SSC Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis, this new partnership is another important step in cementing the club’s place as one of Europe’s top football clubs. “Our goal is to become one of the top clubs not just in Italy but also in Europe. This partnership with OCBC Bank is another important milestone on that journey and we look forward to working closely with them to grow our brand across Asia.”

# SSC Napoli is Among the Largest Soccer Clubs in the Sports Betting World

The Serie A club is ranked as one of the biggest and most successful football clubs in the sports betting world. The Neapolitan outfit has a rich history that goes back to 1926, and it has been crowned champions of Italy on multiple occasions. Napoli is also one of the most popular clubs in Europe, with a large and passionate fanbase that follows the team all over the world.

# The Club’s Early Successes

The early years of Napoli’s history were characterised by continuous success on the pitch. After being founded in 1926, they reached the semi-finals of the Italian Cup in their first season, narrowly losing out to eventual winners Alessandria. They made their debut in Serie A in 1929 and enjoyed a successful first season, finishing fourth in the table. The following year they reached the final of the Coppa Italia, but were beaten by Roma.

In 1936 Napoli finally won their first major trophy, beating Bologna to lift the Coppa Italia. They also finished second in Serie A that season, just two points behind champions Juventus. The club continued to enjoy success in the 1940s, winning two league titles and two Coppa Italias. However, they were unable to replicate this success after the Second World War and eventually dropped down to Serie B in 1953.

# Re-Emergence Under Corrado Ferlaino

Napoli were promoted back to Serie A at the first attempt under new president Corrado Ferlaino. He invested heavily in the squad and appointed Enrico Eco as manager, and this proved to be a shrewd move as Napoli won their first ever Scudetto in 1986/87. They also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup that season, losing out to eventual winners PSV Eindhoven. Ferlaino then stepped down as president but remained involved with Napoli as a business man until his death in 1994.

# Recent Successes

Napoli have continued to enjoy success in recent years, reaching Champions League qualifications on a number of occasions. They won their second league title in 1989/90 but then endured a barren period which saw them finish no higher than sixth place between 1992 and 2003. However, they regained some momentum towards the end of that decade, reaching two Champions League semi-finals (in 2005/06 and 2006/07) and winning their third league title in 2007/08.

# Sports Betting Fuels SSC Napoli Economic Engine

This season, SSC Napoli are having their best ever Serie A campaign. Manager Maurizio Sarri has them playing some of the most attractive football in Europe and they find themselves in second place in the table, behind Juventus only on goal difference. Napoli’s success is down to many factors, but one key one is the team’s ability to attract money from sports betting.

According to a study by the Italian gaming company Intralot, in the 2016/17 season Napoli raked in €57.8 million from sports betting—more than any other club in Serie A. This amounted to over 14% of the club’s total revenue for that season. The next highest earners were Juventus (€53.6 million), Roma (€36.5 million) and Milan (€33.9 million).

Why are Napoli such a popular team to bet on? Partly it’s because they have a large and passionate fan base, but it’s also down to their attacking style of play and the fact that they are usually competitive for major trophies. In addition, many neutrals like to back them against big teams like Juve or Milan, as they see them as underdogs with David-versus-Goliath potential.

The money generated by sports betting is important for Napoli as it helps finance their transfer activities and keeps them competitive with Europe’s top clubs. Last summer they spent over €150 million on new players, including top stars like Jorginho and Lorenzo Insigne. Without the extra revenue from betting, it’s likely they wouldn’t have been able to afford such high-profile signings.

Napoli will be looking to continue their good form in this year’s Champions League campaign; they currently sit second in their group behind Manchester City with two wins and one draw from their first three games. If they can make it through to the knockout stages it will be another payday for the club from sports betting enthusiasts around the world.
