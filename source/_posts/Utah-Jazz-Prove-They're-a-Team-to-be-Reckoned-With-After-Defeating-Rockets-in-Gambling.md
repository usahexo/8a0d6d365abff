#  Utah Jazz Prove They're a Team to be Reckoned With After Defeating Rockets in Gambling

In a matchup that could have gone either way, the Utah Jazz surprised many by taking down the Houston Rockets 111-102. The Jazz were as +7 underdogs according to gambling odds before the game, but they proved that they are a team to be reckoned with in the NBA.

The Rockets came into the game with the best record in the league, but the Jazz were not intimidated. They matched Houston's firepower, outscoring them in three of four quarters. Donovan Mitchell led the way for Utah with 27 points, while Rudy Gobert added 21 points and 16 rebounds.

Houston was led by James Harden's 34 points, but Chris Paul was held to just 12 points on 3-of-14 shooting. The Jazz's defense was able to slow down Paul and keep him from having a big impact on the game.

This upset is a sign of things to come for the Jazz. They have a young and talented roster that is only going to get better as they continue to grow together. With Gobert and Mitchell leading the way, they can compete with anyone in the NBA.

The Rockets still have the best record in the league, but this loss shows that they are not invincible. Other teams in the Western Conference should take note and be prepared for a tough matchup when they face off against Utah.

In what might be one of the most stunning turnarounds in NBA history, the Utah Jazz went from being a 14-point underdog to defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder Wednesday night.
